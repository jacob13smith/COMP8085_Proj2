After the tour, you are able to extend the tour and try 5 chocolates in their tasting room for $5. I would highly recommend this. I absolutely loved all of their chocolates. They even made a banana chocolate taste good. In addition to the great flavors, I absolutely love the fact that they label their chocolates with a capital letter. I hate biting into a chocolate and not knowing the flavor of the chocolate. What a great idea!  \n\nThere are a few additional things worth noting. First, they have an oops wall where they sell their chocolates at a discount. I frequently come here and head straight to the wall where I pick up a $6 pack of strawberry-filled chocolates. Finally, you can buy a $5 reusable bag from them. Every time you come back with the bag, they give you a chocolate covered strawberry for free!

We have just that. Check out what I mean.\n\nI met with Metropolitan Lawn services, I was given three businesses to choose from , and I picked at random, Metropolitan Lawn Services.  I got a call from the secretary of the company named Martine ( ooooh I can use martine right now, ooops sorry I fell off track ) uh huh. I found out that Mr. Brown is 1 of 21 children, that his mother gave birth to. Him being one of the youngest, and all of his brothers and sisters turned out to be valuable contributors to america. What a Feat of His mother. \n\nAnyway Martine ( pronounced, Marteen )took all my info and and before 10 minutes had passed, Mr. Orlando Brown, owner, called me. \n\nWe discussed my needs, what it would cost and we set up a time to meet. We met, He brought one of his best workers, named Sheldon, and the work started. I had requested flowerbeds to be turned over and weeded, my eucalyptus tree to be cut down or cut and trimmed ,my overgrown shrubs and plants to be groomed and trimmed, my crepe myrtles to be trimmed at the knuckles (as per Orlando, he told me to call him Orlando, nah, dat's right, uh huh) to remove the the elephant ears and weedy trees from my carport, to mulch and reset the edging with a different look all around two thirds of the house, to remedy my tuff barn roof that was damages by eta, to trim my hedges and to give my lawn and grass its normal treatment. He does more than lawn services.\n\nI told my bosses at YELP, I was given Metropolitan as one of the three to use and I would give them the skivvy on my experience to, hopefully change the negative review this business got and metropolitan will get the accolades deserved.  Here goes, he, Mr. Orlando was on time, he had every move synced. His staffer Martine was there to advise Orlando of any info that couldn't reach Orlando quickly, she's a good secretary a sweetheart, and a people person.\n\nOrland had every piece of equipment he needed to complete the job, he and Sheldon, had every segment cleaned up along the completion of the segment. Mr. Orlando is also a humanitarian. He has Sheldon who is a senior citizen  working,  who has somewhat of a pretty harsh past who is his right hand, as far as being dependable and capable,  While doing my job, Orlando had 70 0dd Yelp request pending a quote. That in itself speaks for his business capabilities.\n\nWhat was the greatest part of this experience with Mr. Orlando Brown was the love for his wife and their future. That the job he does with his business secures their future and the  ability to hire young women from little opportunities, no matter what color, and young men with dreams of building their communities black and white and the knowledge of the usage of God's given earth. \n\nHence, my experience was positive. Mr. Brown carried out every thing I needed, and he even allowed me to do my own thing ie., letting my plants and yard know that I was in the mix, my signature was on the job. That I dug into some things that I felt very close to, meant volumes to me.\n\nY'all  dat's how we roll heah in Na'U' Ally N'u'Awlins Y'all. Orlando Brown gives his best  no matter what level economically is your home.  I am as  happy as a bird on a conveyor belt of birdseed, huh, yeah I said dat, Call him y'all tell him where u heard about him, drop your  YELP APP it's free.

After several weeks of closure and losing a couple of hired hands, they're chugging back along. Phone was ringing like mad, a few walk-in folks too (of whom I was one).  Same friendly young couple is still running it with extended family. Hubby was at wok tonight while wifey ran register and answered phone.\n\nThese folks have not lost a beat, either. They still don't deliver, but that isn't likely to change anytime soon. That, and a somewhat mediocre egg roll still leaves them at a good 4-Star rating. I'd say 4 and a half, actually.\n\nQueen Bee got her usual Krab Rangoon. I don't see how she likes a plain old fried wonton skin with cream cheese and krab juice. She does, though: especially here. Same holds true for her own thought process  as I had the usual shrimp toast. Greasy, guilty pleasure that would make Forrest Gump proud. He'd also have to walk another 100 miles to burn off all those oily carbs...either that or keel over dead of a coronary after chowing down on these four bad boys!\n\nWonton soup still yummy; good broth and some scallion pieces complement the non soggy and pleasantly plump packages of porcine pasta pleasure. Egg roll crisp and decent sized for a FL take out joint. A lot of bok Choi and carrot; little pork. Eh...\n\nThree items ordered to see if they still have it down in the old Doo Wok A Doo Department. General Tso chicken and also roast pork with snow peas. Last one was my go to pork fried rice.  Queen Bee likes the first as a rule and she LOVED this rendition. Pieces of real white meat chicken still a little crisp and packed a wee bit of good heat at the end.\n\nPork with snow peas also great! Generous amount of sliced pork, along with a nice load of tender, snappy pea pods, along with some bok Choi, water chestnuts, etc in a fantastic sauce. BTW: see those pictures I posted? Those were both the SMALL size!\n\nPork fried rice was jammed to the brim of the oyster pail. They got it just the way I like: dark, well done and with a load of bean sprouts.  Both of the owners are very receptive to special requests like this. I guess it helps that I know them and they recognize me. \n\nLast item is that they put up plexiglass at the counter, and even had a mike-and-speaker system installed. There's also a trap door for cash and a bigger one for food bags...no touching or close contact at all. Their small dining area is now totally blocked off by the tables, which are now used for paper goods, sauces and menus. Take it and go! Yay, China One!!!","date":"2020-05-24 21:55:37"}

It was so frustrating, but made it back after snagging an uber and arrived around 10pm to the hotel. I checked in right away and tried to get to bed right away, as a 7am flight out of New Orleans was on deck the next morning. I have enjoyed the La Quinta hotel brand whenever I get a chance, although sometimes in some cities, this brand can be a bit more pricey than normal. In this case, it was around my price range and it had an airport shuttle, so I can make my flight out of New Orleans on time. Prices per night hover around $75-$90 per night without the taxes and fees, which is reasonable for someone like me on a budget. The check in service was good and fast.  For the airport shuttle, since it was the first trip of the morning at 5am, we just had to be present in the lobby 10 minutes prior to departure. The front desk said sometimes the complimentary breakfast opens early for guests who leave early, but it wasn't the case for me. I eventually found something at the airport for breakfast. \n\nAll in all, can't complain too much. The La Quinta hotel and suites here in Kenner was a good place to rest my head and it's close to the airport for a fast and easy exit. The overall experience here at this La Quinta hotel and Suites - New Orleans airport was nice, clean, and quick, especially when you have a 7am flight departure the next morning. Everything seems like a quicker stay when that happens. This La Quinta hotel and suites is located at 2610 Williams Blvd in Kenner and about 1.5 miles from the main terminal at the New Orleans international airport. Best bet would be to take the airport shuttle to and from the airport, but you'd probably need to call them when you're ready for pick up. Or if you want to get there sooner, consider Uber or Lyft at your discretion, although it'll be cheap, probably around $10. The La Quinta hotel and suites accepts major credit cards, which is always a good thing. They also check your driver's license for identity. They have a generous parking options here too.  There is public transportation options here too, take the Jefferson Transit or New Orleans Transit Authority bus from the airport, where there's a stop there and one on Veteran's Blvd and Williams Blvd. Take Route E-1.\n\nFor the most part though, my stay here at the La Quinta hotels and suites near the New Orleans airport was brief, but needed. The room itself was standard and clean. The bed was a king bed and it was quite nice to be able to get in a good 6 hours or so before waking up and scrambling to check out and make it to the airport shuttle on time. Everything worked properly in the room, although I did not use the television during my stay, nor the microwave or the mini fridge. I wished I did, but I can thank the delayed Amtrak train for not having to enjoy those amenities at the hotel. I did enjoy this one episode while waiting for the airport shuttle. This guest was pretty frantic about getting back into her room, trying to get her belongings, but the front desk staff was adamant about not letting her back into the hotel room, since she wasn't the one who made the reservation. I knew it was a liability and safety issue for the hotel employees, but its tough luck for this lady.  My heart goes out to the lady, but what can you do? Still, it was an interesting way to wake up on a Monday morning, that's for sure. I would recommend staying here, if you had a late arrival or early departure out of New Orleans international airport. Or if you're passing through the area and need a place, that's good too. The hotel is clean and comfortable and somewhat budget friendly, but safe. Quite nice for a getaway in New Orleans.\n\n4.0 stars for the overall experience. 4.0 stars for the check in and out service. 3.0 stars for the prices, but 4.5 stars for the room comfort and the 6 hours of deep sleep.\n\nSupport local!\n\nB","date":"2019-12-06 23:17:01"}

When I booked the reservation, I booked it for Wyndham.  Well upon arrival, we learned it had changed ownership and is now the Omni.  \n\nThe bellman, I believe his name was Chris, was the shining star of this overpriced hotel.  He was so helpful and attentive.  Upon checking in, we learned they just changed ownership that Monday (we arrive on Thursday).\n\nThe room itself was nice, as we were in the corner room that overlooks the outlet mall and convention center, so it's one of their largest rooms.  The problem, I soon discovered, is you could hear all the freakin' traffic down below.  So I went downstairs and asked the front desk person if I could have a floor fan delivered to my room.  You would have thought I was speaking Chinese or something because this guy gave me the stupidest look, then said they don't have floor fans.  What the hell kind of \"upscale\" hotel doesn't have a floor fan ... if nothing else, the maintenance people use them to dry wet floors.  I have NEVER had a hotel tell me they didn't have one.  He stated I could go buy one ... well no shit dude ... but I'm fairly sure I won't be able to pack that in my suitcase on the flight home!!\n\nFlash forward a few hours ... we asked if they had bottled water in the rooms (even if I had to pay 3 times what it would normally cost to drink it) and the same jerk at the front desk tells me there's a vending machine on my floor.  AGAIN, I ask you, what the HELL kind of upscale hotel doesn't have bottled water in the room, whether complimentary or for purchase, and instead wants to inconvenience me by making me walk to it, especially if I want some water in the middle of the night???\n\nMy other complaint for my room is that the bathroom door isn't really a door, it's more like a sliding door you would find in an old barn ... not very private (I could look through the crack and see our bed) so if you're sharing the room with someone other than a spouse, they will hear all of your business while you're in there and you will feel awkward!

I'll bring you some chips. \" I'm not an idiot - chips are free for all tables! Then took 10 min to bring our drinks overs and take our orders. Got the shrimp quesadilla appetizer which was the only redeeming factor of this meal. Great big juicy shrimp and corn with peppers and onions. It was delicious. The guacamole with it however was bland and completely flavorless. It was also quite brown from sitting out too long. Then came the entrees - short rib tacos and the taco trio. Both of our entrees were room temperature at best. The short rib was flavorful but dry and the white sauce on it was awful and a weird texture. The taco trio was nothing special - the chicken was dry, bland, and cold, the carnitas was the best one but also room temp. \n\nCertainly would never come back to this location.","date":"2015-12-06 04:44:46"}

I ordered a salad that was incorrect. I shared this with the server before leaving and it was made the correct way. The salad was really good but I was disappointed after reviewing my bank statement. I  noticed that my credit card was charged $42.00. The salad was only $19.98. I woke up this morning to notice another charge of $39.96. The only charge should be $19.98 for the salad. I called several times today to speak with a manager and haven't received a call back. I was told that the manager wouldn't be in until 4pm. I decided to go to the restaurant to discuss this matter with someone in person. When I arrived I was told again that the manager was not in and they didn't know when he would arrive. I find it very strange that there isn't a manager or supervisor on site to speak with customers. \n\n\nThe bartender came over to speak with me and stated that the message was passed along to the manger via text. I began to share the issue with my credit card being charged multiple times. I was told that the manager would be the person to call me back as they have \" no access to the accounts\". The bartender then became very defensive and rude as I began to say how this was unacceptable. He stated that I know you called \"6 times\" but it's nothing we could do. I thought that was very rude. I informed him that my card has been charged multiple times and I will continue to call until this is handled. Let me make it clear that the $39.96 was charged TODAY. As I was talking my mask started to slide down. I continued to pull the mask up but was yelled at by the bartender\" can you pull your mask up\". I informed him that the mask was sliding and I understand the importance of having a mask on. \n\nI still haven't heard from the manager and my card is still charged $81.00. I must say there was a server that came by to listen to my story. I didn't catch her name but she was sweet and very helpful. She listened and agreed to follow up with the manager. There was a black gentleman that came over to simple listen to the conversation or play pretend security. Not sure why he was even called over to the door. Maybe the bartender didn't like my tone and felt as if he needed the black server to assist him? Anyway, I am planning to contact my bank to dispute this matter further. I will NO longer spend a dime at this restaurant. Anyone who decides to come here, make sure to have cash!!!  FYI: Still no call back from the manager!!\n\n\nUpdate: manager called me back!

She let me know that she'd be with me in just a moment, but people kept stopping her at the counters she was standing near before she could get to me. Finally, after 10 minutes (yes, really), I asked one of the jewelry counter associates if there was anyone else who would help me because the other woman had too many customers to get to me. A minute or two later someone from one of the other jewelry counters came by, asked if I knew what it was I wanted (not at all rudely, she just was't familiar with cosmetics and therefore couldn't offer much help). I did know which gloss I wanted, but I wanted to see a few other colors because all they had displayed were a variation on a brown theme. She called someone to find out where the lip glosses I wanted even were, and also asked if there were other colors besides what was displayed. Apparently there weren't.

I am familiar with world class Basque food.\nThat being said, I'm not sure if it was a post-covid staffing issue or the kitchen. The meal started with a warm clam chowder that was closer to a potato soup. The next course was a salad that was wilted and rusty. It was un-eaten by the other  guest as well. They then served a warm Basque chicken dish, very good but again only warm temp. The next course was the beans, and they were hot and excellent. Then there was a long wait until my New York steak came out, and the beans were cold by then.  \nThe family Basque style is about the pace of the serving of the multiple entrees. They need some help. I want them to thrive, they are a Reno institution.","date":"2021-09-12 15:53:36"}

We had two servers one had to leave due it being the end of his shift. I believe his name was Tommy or Tim. He gave a wonderful recommendation for a bourbon inspired drink, which was awesome. We ordered the calamari and the spinach and cheese dip.  The calamari was gummy the spinach dip was cold.  After that was fixed we all ordered. My niece and daughter shared a children's pizza. My mother, sister  and aunt ordered steaks. I ordered a pasta and shrimp dish.  So,  two of of three steaks were cold.  The sauce for my dish was bland and mainly butter. My niece vomitted twice, we ended up cleaning it up no one from the waitstaff helped out.  Or replacement server was in a few words lacked quality as well as did not do the proper steps of service.

So my story may not be the case for everyone, but buying a car here was truly one of the worst mistakes I have made in my life thus far. I bought a car here in April 2015. I had recently totalled my car, and I was a poor college student who needed a car fast to commute to work and school. My dad had recently passed away and my mom was living half way across the country, so I was basically on my own buying a car. The guy that sold me my car here seemed nice enough and I thought I was getting a decent deal. I bought a 2003 Subaru Forester and paid close to $4,000 after tax and tags. So, not a ton of money but enough that I thought it would be able to last me at least a year. The car I bought here was the definition of a lemon.  I should've known as soon as I got the inspection done with their place, that it was no good. They agreed to pay for whatever it needed to pass inspection, which surprisingly was nothing. It passed inspection with a windshield chip right in front of the drivers view, so of course I was left to deal with that. \n\nI'm not car-savy at all, but within the first month I was able to figure out the head gasket was leaking. It probably was doing this when I bought it. Pro sport motors did honor their \"warranty\" that if anything happened within the first month they would pay for 50% of the work if done through their mechanic. So, that would've earned them a higher yelp rating if not for the events that followed. (See my review of the Getty in Conshohocken). But, long story short my car was at their mechanic for three weeks. When I finally picked it up, it had a loud sound that wasn't there before. The next day, when I was driving my car to work it broke down which was very scary. Pro Sport Motors sent a tow out and brought it back to their shop. Somehow, due to whatever was done at the Getty, the exhaust pipe became detached from the car and the car was leaking antifreeze due to one of the hoses being tied too tightly. They fixed it and gave it back to me. But, what they failed to tell me which I would later find out months down the line is the headgasket was either not repaired or repaired incorrectly. \n\nBasically, in my time of having this car up until April 2016, there was always problems. From the time of buying this car until April. I put at least $2,000 dollars into it (stupid, I know). Thankfully, I have since found a reliable mechanic and when I brought my car in for inspection this year( I already knew it had a ton of problems) he told me the headgasket was never fixed, some other expensive things it needed, and that it was absolutely not worth putting anymore money into it. By the time I sold this car in May, the best price I could get for it was $400!! As much as I think leasing a car is a waste of money, I could've leased a brand new car and spent less money than I did in my year with this car($6000+). I can't even tell you how much buying this car has negatively affected my life. It sounds dramatic, but I have had to delay important events in my life due to the amount of money spent on this car and still not having a reliable car. This car was the giant albatross around my neck, and I am so happy to just be done dealing with it. I'm kind of embarrassed telling this story, but I have definitely learned my lesson. I personally will never buy a used car after this unless it is certified from the dealer, or from someone in my family. Never again!!!","date":"2016-10-16 17:11:58"}

Clean and bright with an open reception area, lockers, three showers, and a blow-dry station - it is setup for you to easily head to work after your workout.\n\nOrange theory is a zone based workout and good for all fitness levels. When you arrive, you will borrow or buy their heart rate monitor. The monitor connects with the OTF system and displays your heart rate, zone, calories burned and the \"splat points\" - which are basically the top two heart rate zones.\n\nWorried people are looking at your numbers? They are not. If they are, they got ripped off because you are working hard enough in these classes that you won't have time to look over the other numbers on that screen!\n\nI have knee issues and use alternatives for many parts of class, coaches are great about that. Rowers, treadmills, free weights, bosu, TRX, etc.\n\nI burn 400-600 calories in every class I have attended. Coach Erin was great. I have also taken class from Coach Lauren, as she teaches in Bloomington too - she is the best!\n\nGive it a try! First workout is free.","date":"2018-07-10 22:34:53"}

Very herby\n\nOnce we got seated, I ordered some oysters for the table. I love oysters and am absolutely obsessed with them. Market price when I went was $20 for half a dozen. The oysters were so fresh and it comes with a sherry vinegar and cocktail sauce I believe. I generally prefer my oysters with just a touch of lemon but I also enjoyed the vinegar - not so much a fan of the cocktail sauce\n\nFor my main, I ordered seared ahi tuna which is one of my favorite dishes. Hendrys does it right! The sear is perfect as you can see the beautiful tuna in the middle. It comes with tempura vegetables which had a nice crunch but a little lackluster when it comes to flavor. Perhaps a sauce would benefit it. You also get a bed of rice which was not too dry or wet and infused with great flavor and spices but not to the point where it overwhelmed the dish. \n\nI also ordered the feel good hit of the summer which was a seasonal drink. Honestly did not really enjoy it - it almost tasted like pickle juice... \n\nI think I would come back here during happy hour when the drinks are a better price but the food was really amazing - just a bit on the pricier side for some items. Disappointingly it was so gloomy when I came but I would love to come back on a sunny morning for some breakfast or lunch","date":"2021-06-03 17:09:54"}

This restaurant has recently re-located from Upper Darby to a cozy spot on Rittenhouse Place in Ardmore. Parking is plentiful.  Meters before 6 PM.  There are some tables, however they clearly expect more takeout than dine-in business.\n\nOur first occasion was as a dine-in, two kids, Faithful Dining Companion, the Reverend Dr. Steak and Honorable Pastor Ribs and Oldest, Dearest Friend all headed there on a Friday night.  We were happy to find they could accommodate our size.  \n\nWe ordered a variety of items - filet mignon sandwich, ribs, brisket, pulled pork.  Also got greens and mac & cheese.  All were 'very good'.  Brisket was not *quite* Percy Street nor was the pork.  Ribs were OK, a bit chewy, not nearly up to what Luther con cots at Ribs R Us.  The mac & cheese was good but a bit clumpy.  Filet Mignon was  probably the best of the offerings.  \n\nService was OK, the server appeared inexperienced and somewhat lost at times.  \n\nWhile we were there, we observed a steady parade of people coming in, picking up giant bags of food, and leaving. \n\nSo, on another day we decided to order the takeout, got the chicken, brisket and ribs.  The chicken ROCKS the house. Very succulent, nice flavor, tender and moist.  Yum.  I have no idea if it's Peruvian, whatever it is, it was highly enjoyable.  Brisket and ribs, again good.\n\nWe would get the chicken again, take out.  Not sure if I would bother sitting down again as the parade of take-outs was distracting.  \n\nIt's BYOB, if you forgot yours and you want to dine in, the Rittenhouse deli exactly 2 doors away sells beer.

In full disclosure, we were the last table seated on a Sunday evening and it was the day after Christmas so maybe they had the \"B\" team on the floor and\/or in the kitchen. But when your menu is $30+ for a main, then you have to deliver every night. \n\nFirst, the best parts. Our party of four started with the deviled eggs, wedge salad and the winter squash soup. Of the three dishes, the deviled eggs were by far the standout with perfectly balanced flavors of dill, sweet and spice. The wedge salad was fine and only memorable because of the bacon. The soup was a little disappointing. The texture was a bit grainy which may have been a deliberate chef's choice. If so, we prefer our squash soups a little smoother. But the server was served slightly warm but not nearly as hot as one would expect. That said, the fritters served on the side were outstanding and deserve their own spot on the appetizer menu. \n\nOur main courses were the filet mignon, the spare ribs, the chicken and biscuits (from the appetizers) and the pork chops. The filet mignon and spare ribs were the stars of the show. The filet was perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth tender with a demi glace that was wonderfully rich and flavorful. That filet is as good as (better than!) anything you'll find at a high-end steak house. \n\nThe spare ribs were right up there with the filet. So perfectly tender that the meat fell cleanly off each bone. The sauce was the right blend of sweet and savory and in just the right proportion. Like the soup, the ribs were served luke warm which perhaps was chef's choice but we would preferred they arrived at the table a little hotter. \n\nWe also liked the chicken and biscuits. The biscuits were light and flaky which could also describe the breading on the chicken.  Not sure we'd go back just for the chicken and biscuits but we would order them again. \n\nThis brings us to the Ill fated pork chop. On the plus side, the sauce and plantains served on the side were delicious. But the pork chop was simply over cooked (or it sat in the pass for too long).  We found it difficult to cut even with the serrated steak knife provided and the pork itself dry, tough and chewy which deprived it of any pork flavor.  We can see the potential in this dish had it been cooked properly so that the pork was moist and tender.\n\nFinally, we felt let down by the service. It started by us waiting at the host's station for several minutes before anyone acknowledging us. Once we were seated our water glasses were promptly filled by a server who said nothing even when we spoke to him. Once the waters were filled, we waited just over ten minutes before the server returned to our table to take the drink orders. At that point he was cordial but terse in his delivery. We also couldn't help but notice things like the server reaching across the table (and our dining companions) to hand off a dish rather than walking around the table and setting it down in front of the diner who ordered the dish. This might sound nit-picky but not the kind of service you expect from a restaurant of this caliber.","date":"2021-12-27 14:22:25"}

They were probably the only best part of the meal.  The cornbread was just okay - it was definitely on the harder side and didn't really have too much flavor to it.  The pulled pork sandwich was also a disappointment.  It was dry and not at all flavorful.  The only good part of it was the BBQ sauce but that was also minuscule and was only located at a small part of the sandwich.  The rest didn't even have BBQ sauce on it.  I finished it cause I was starving but honestly it wasn't that great.\n\nMy friend ordered the half rack of ribs.  She thought it was okay but I tried a bit of her ribs and they were SO DRY.  (She also tried my pulled pork and said it was dry as well...so that goes to show that the two meats we tried was just too dry).  It also lacked flavor and overall wasn't that great. \n\nVery disappointed overall but definitely loved those grits!","date":"2017-10-03 13:59:14"}

Probably the reason that I'd never heard of this place when I went with a friend for lunch the other day. \n\nI ordered a salad, the Asian chicken to be exact, and was terribly disappointed. The salad was actually just a little iceberg lettuce chopped up. Nothing very appetizing about iceberg, but it was around $10 so I wasn't going to be too hard on it. But then there was barely any chicken. A lot of the chicken was chewy in a strange way. Most of the salad itself was actually a butt-ton of tortilla strips. It was mostly tortilla. \n\nFriend ordered a vegetable burger with mushrooms. They forgot mushrooms and instead gave her a butt-ton of pickles she'd asked them not to include. It was taken back but they didn't replace the bun that had pickle juice on it. Just removed the pickles and slapped some grilled mushrooms on top. I'm not a big complainer, but that seems lazy to me. \n\nI ordered two slices of pie to take home. Despite the waitress saying they had the salted caramel creme that I wanted, she came back a good 8 minutes later to tell me they were out. I changed to one chocolate silk and one pumpkin harvest slice. Both were pretty good. I was not a huge fan of the crust on the pumpkin harvest, but it was tasty overall. \n\nMostly, the service was bad, which added to lack-luster foods. The waitress took forever to get us drinks. Even longer to notice we needed refills. There seemed to be one waitress for about five tables, but I expected a bit more attention to detail. When we asked for the check, we waited (yes, literally) for 22 minutes before getting the check. The waitress disappeared and when she came back to wipe down a table across from us she looked over and said, \"Oh, are you still here?\" Yes because we still needed the check. This was probably my only chance to dine-and-dash and I missed it. Darn. \n\nShe gives us the check. Takes her several minutes to come back to take our cards to pay. I feel bad if they're working her that hard that she can't get back and forth to guests in a timely manner. \n\nThe pie was ok.

It definitely isn't a ham sandwich, which is my only pork sandwich comparison. It was so JUICY. We had gotten the sandwiches cut in half so we could each have half of each sandwich to try. I tried the half Philly first and the pesto gave it a little lightness that all the pork definitely needed. It was a really nice balance (but still a big bite and a heavy meal!) We hadn't expected pickled cauliflower on the Cubano but those pickled veggies (the gardenia) were so necessary. The cracklin on both provided a nice crunchy texture. Unfortunately the gruyere on our Cubano was melted almost to smithereens and was practically non-existent, but there was already so much flavor that it was almost okay?

Ceviche is that perfect spot. \n\nTo start, we got the bread and I ordered the Siete cocktail. The bread was great and it was served with a chimichuri which was so herby and fresh. My mom said we need more bread when she had her first bite. The cocktail of gin, lavender and crème de violet was incredible. It was so balanced. I could have drank 20 and crawled home (with an empty wallet). \n\nWe then got a couple cold plates including the deviled eggs and the octopus ceviche. The deviled eggs were good, but just deviled eggs really, nothing special, you could skip them. The ceviche was great. My mom even gave it a try and she really enjoyed it. The red onion and cilantro gave it a great punch of flavor and the octopus was very mild and tender. \n\nWe then moved on to our hot dishes. First was the Potatoes with spicy aioli. They are a popular item for a reason, just simply good and great flavors. Next we received the scallops, lamb and Picanha. These were the stars of the show. The scallops were perfect in every sense, hard sear and perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth. They were served over an amazing fire roasted corn with chorizo. It really doesn't get better than this. Well until maybe the lamb chops over eggplant capanada with dill and feta. Those flavors together were borderline orgasmic. Close your eyes and savor every bite. Lastly, we received the Picanha with mushrooms and chimichurri. Yet again, phenomenal. Every bite was so good, savor worthy, rave worthy. \n\nService was fantastic, great views and vibes, the prices were great. I would never hesitate to recommend this to anyone. It was probably the best meal I've had in my 10 years of visiting the area. Please go try it!","date":"2021-10-19 01:18:24"}

And with my first bite, I just thanked God that I had found great ramen in Tucson, AZ and my cravings would be satisfied!! This ramen was spectacular. I couldn't even believe it. It was rich. It was smooth. AND it was the perfect amount of flavor and not drowned in salt like many other ramen I've had at pretty reputable places!!

The Coconut Shrimp is what we usually order as appetizers.  The last meal I had was the red curry shrimp pasta, sautéed shrimp in a red curry sauce over pasta.  I keep the pasta for my dishes.

We left for a little while and then decided to come back and she had everything all written out for us regarding our bike settings and ensured we got our teacher discount.

At that time, the store said to discard the buffet.\nI paid to have the item shipped to my home because  I didn't have the means to transport it; therefore, discarding this item is impossible.

However, in reading your comment that \"they are bad people - who hire the worst of the worst as movers\" I respectfully disagree. And here's why I disagree. The company as with any company is in business to make money. When they hire people to perform manual labor, they hire the people they can get at the lowest possible wage. It is apparent that the people hired are not professional movers. Professional movers come at a much higher cost that include - union wages.   Elvis Movers would not pay union wages so, what do they get. They hire people who they believe can lift and carry furniture. So, at the end of the day what you have as workers are a group of men, wanting a day's pay for a day of labor. Grossly untrained and inexperienced yes, but still willing to do an honest day of work, for an honest day of pay.  The \"worst of the worst - as movers\", perhaps. Did they make a bad impression as a mover, or failed to meet an acceptable work standard, in their overall performance as a mover perhaps, but a \"bad people\" ... I don't think so. Webster defines a bad person as atrocious; corrupt, cruel, debauched, degraded, demoralized deplorable, injurious, loathsome, obnoxious, sinful, etc. Did your movers in fact fit this description?\n\nI'm sorry that you too, had a nightmarish experience with this company. But I salute you for taking the time to tell others of the grief and damage that Elvis Movers can cause a family to have. I think one of the major problems that Elvis Movers have, is the type of furniture that they agree to move. For example: If you are moving well-made heavy furniture - that has some real weight to it, Elvis inexperienced movers - would not be the best people to handle thistype of move. However, if you have light weight furniture - like a lot of college students have, or IKEA type furniture, then I believe, that this is what Elvis Movers are used to handling, and can perform well in doing that. \n\nElvis Movers banged up my heavy furniture badly. After a day or two checking the damage they had caused I was devastated. So much so that I was unable to hold a civil conversation with anyone at Elvis Movers. A couple of days later I concluded that it was I who sought Elvis movers out for a contract, because they were inexpensive.  I made a bad decision, trying to save money. I choose them, it was not the other way around. There's an old saying that goes ... you get what you pay for. Elvis Movers company prices are considerably less than other companies. Which may explain why their performance is also less than other companies. \n\nBut to say...they are bad people who employ the worst of the worst as workers again, I say respectfully, I disagree. From where I sit, they appear to be a group of people while unskilled, and untrained with not much business savvy, at a minimum they are a group of human beings  trying to find a place and earn an honest living in this cold cruel, society. It could be that some are disadvantaged, lacking the required skills to be proficient as a mover, but still moving forward to earn an honest dollar to meet their needs. Even if it is only for one day at a time. An honest dollar earned is good for the soul; the spirit, for society, and of equal importance it instills hope, for a better tomorrow. Hopfully, Elvis Movers will take heed to all of this negative press and invest in a business consultant to make their business grow and become better. \n\nBad people,...no I disagree. Unskilled people absolutely,...Yes!  Lesson learned. It's unfortunate, but I wouldnt use Elvis Movers again, even if they came to me Free of Charge!","date":"2019-01-23 04:42:54"}

This spot lives up to the hype! As I was driving here for the first time, I saw the long line of people through the parking lot before I even saw the sign. Word on the street is that there's always a line, which is a great indicator that there's good food inside. \n\nThis spot is a seafood hut within a liquor store off of Keystone. There is no interior to it, rather you line up outside, order, and take your food to-go. Luckily, the line goes pretty quickly and my food was ready in only a few minutes. It's the time of COVID, and it was cool to see all of the people in line waiting six feet apart, even without being told to. Everyone really respected that and was also in their masks. \n\nNow let's talk food. There's a menu posted up outside, and you order from that. Essentially, you choose your seafood, trap buttah sauce, and whether you want it either loaded (with all the veggies - corn, broccoli, cauliflower, potatoes, boiled egg) or non and whether you want it spicy or not. For seafood, you can choose salmon, shrimp, crab legs, crab tails, or a combo of those. For buttahs, you can choose garlic herb, yaad jerk, sweet Thai chili, island curry, or vegan citrus chive. You can even buy a bottle of trap buttah or FoodLoveTog seasoning (mild, medium, or spicy) to take home with you. And you'll want to. \n\nI got the loaded shrimp platter with OG garlic herb buttah and mild seasoning. Every bite was delicious, and for $16, I got two completely full to-go boxes of food.

I booked appointments for me and 2 friends as a treat. Overall the way this Philly location was run seems low class and unprofessional. I love drybar products and have been looking forward to trying the service for a long time so this was seriously awful.\n\n- The front desk receptionist asked for our drinks but never brought them \nThe receptionist called me back to the hair wash area - all she said was my name (yelling from across the room). So I followed her back and sat down, took out my earrings. She still said NOTHING (as in, not a SINGLE WORD) to me but hollered out at her work friends. Eventually I turned around and said \"I've actually never been here before so if you could communicate with me what to do that would be great\" and her response was \"I'm waiting for you to lean back\" with a nasty attitude. She started to wet my hair, then turned to the person next to her and said \"I don't want to wash HER hair, you do it.\" Humiliating, unkind, and uncalled for. If a request for communication sends her over the edge, she shouldn't be working in a salon. I heard other hair washers asking if the person was comfortable, etc like the normal things that happen when you get your hair washed...\n- She didn't tell the person who took over washing my hair that I had signed up for a floater, so when the new person acted like I was done, I told her I was supposed to get a scalp massage. She took care of it and was nicer.\n- The stylist was just OK. He didn't ask if I wanted a drink and wasn't overly friendly but whatever. I told my stylist I wanted the mai tai with slightly more curl - still never got a drink - he ended up giving me LESS curl than in the pictures, it looked nice but was not what I asked for. At this point I was just done. \n- During my hair styling appointment the receptionist who was nasty to me earlier came back to talk to my stylist about HER haircut he was doing on Monday, they looked at pics together and chit chatted. I honestly felt harrassed by her at this point, and I had told my stylist about the incident, so he should have sent her away instead of engaging. It just made things even more uncomfortable.\n- I had to check out with this god awful receptionist and I didn't have cash to tip so unfortunately had to tell her what to add on (mostly tipping for my friend's service that I was paying for at this point). She double charged my tip - seems highly suspicious since she had asked if it was per stylist or total and I clearly said total - and did not offer a receipt. Luckily I asked so I could get it corrected despite her heinous attitude throughout.\n- I had severe neck pain from either the hair washing sink or my stylist pulling my hair extremely hard during the blow dry after a few hours. It still hurts today. I have NEVER had that happen at any other salon.\n- In terms of cleanliness, there were hair balls on the floor and I got to watch the receptionist pull a giant hair ball out of the sink right before she touched my hair - ew.","date":"2017-06-04 15:36:52"}

It's because of the WOMAN MANAGER. If I could leave a negative review, I would.\n\nI stopped going to this store for two reasons (even though it's literally 2 minutes from my house).\n1) Very limited selection\n2) The woman manager is a disgustingly unprofessional human being\n\nAlmost every single time I went in there, this manager was rude to customers. You know, they people who pay her salary. She was never rude to me because luckily I never had to interact with her - minus the time I told her a bird was dying in an enclosure and she did absolutely nothing about it...and when I check the bird a few minutes later, it was dead. The only reason this store has any business is because the closest chain pet store is 15 miles away.\n\nI went to PetSmart in Brandon today (the chain 15 miles away) to get items I needed, and I gladly spent $150. Unfortunately they did not have the kitten food I needed, so dreadfully I had to stop into Pet Supermarket on my way home.\n\nI walk up to the store and there was a young employee bringing in carts. As I passed him, I said hello. He didn't respond (which is fine because he's was a kid). I proceed into the store and go left towards the cat aisles. I hear someone saying \"ma'am\" a few times. No \"excuse me ma'am\" or anything polite in the slightest. I turn around and the kid was speaking to me. He literally said \"go get hand sanitizer\". No please, no thank you. I get the sanitizer. He goes off towards the registers and I continue onward down an aisle by myself - no customers or employees in sight and mumble something under my breath as I'm turning the corner. I almost bumped into an employee, named Cayanne (another young kid) who was sitting on the ground stocking shelves.\n\nI pass her and go to the cat food. I'm looking on the shelves and she said to me \"is there something you wanted to say to me?\" I said \"oh no, I was just mumbling under my breath, talking to myself.\" Meanwhile I'm thinking if this was my employee, she would have a nice talking to about not being confrontational to the people who give her a paycheck. She leaves the aisle. \n\nI'm looking around, reading ingredients and hear someone literally right in my ear say \"is there something you wanted  to say to me?\" I turn around and it's the most unprofessional human on the planet - the woman Manager. I said \"if I had a question, I would've asked you.\" She said \"well you said something about my employee, so why don't you say it to me.\" I proceed with \"first of all, how do you know what I was mumbling to myself had anything to do with your employee, and you are very unprofessional for coming up behind me to get in my face.\" She tried to continue to argue with me so I turned around and grabbed the food I needed. She decides to walk along side me and I say \"I will be contacting corporate for your disgusting behavior\". She said \"make sure to tell them what you said about my employee.\" I said \"why don't you do that since you seem to know more than I do.\"\n\nWe live in a world where I can talk to myself whenever I want, can mumble to myself whenever I want, and don't have to have some angry ass woman try to start a fight with me over something I MUMBLED TO MYSELF. She is lucky this didn't occur outside of the store. Very lucky.\n\nI wasn't shocked by this disgusting woman doing this, as I heard her tell an older couple who was adopting a cat (they didn't have a carrier) that it was \"common sense to bring your own carrier\". I almost chewed her ass out that day for that disgusting remark to those customers, but decided that was the day I would never return unless absolutely necessary. \n\nThis is a serious lack of professionalism and it is disgusting Pet Supermarket would even hire such a scumbag - especially put her in a management position. And now she's training her little kid employees to be disgusting too. \n\nShe needs to get fired and get a reality check. Pet Supermarket should know better than to have such a bitch managing employees and dealing with customers.","date":"2020-09-05 23:41:11"}

The lady who checked us in and was running the front desk most of the time (including during the parade) was very welcoming and helpful.  The rooms were nice and we had a room that overlooked the fire station and the Irish bar.  As well as an apartment with funny Halloween decorations.  Our friend had a room with a balcony over the pool and some friendly guests across the way that used theirs a lot and we enjoyed chatting with them.  We could have seen the parade from her balcony but chose to go down to the street.  The pool was nice and chill and the very friendly restocking the towels let us know that we could use the pool also at their sister hotel but we never made it over there.  But it was a chill place for midday but don't expect any food or drinks because their restaurant is non-existant.\n\nThe Cons -\n\n- There is no continental breakfast (they say because of Covid)\n- There is no room service because of Covid but they said to just call if we needed it and\/or needed anything\n- The one morning we did need our coffee and tea pods replenished and we called them to ask for more, the lady was not helpful at all and told us to come down to the lobby to get it.  Sorry, but I'm in my pajamas which is why I was asking for someone to bring us some.  Not going down to the lobby in my pj shorts and tank!!\n- Beware - there really was no restaurant.  Sure, they have a sign at all the elevators that make the food look delicious but is never open (4 pm - 10 pm) and even then they wouldn't seat us and they weren't doing room service.  This is no fault of the hotel because it's obviously run separately but should not appear to be the hotel restaurant because it's not and does nothing for the hotel guests (separate review coming for them)\n\nAlso the hotel is walking distance to the french quarter and the hotel.

I don't know why I haven't been here sooner.  Ok, I do know why ~ it's quite a drive from our home, but heck, I wouldn't have minded the drive had I known it was gonna be this good.\nWe came here for breakfast.  We decided, instead of eating somewhere after a hike, we would eat first and then go hike.  I checked the trusted Yelp, and Creme popped up.  They open early, so we decided to go there.  I'm so happy we did. \nIt's a small, yet cozy little place.  There was a fair amount of people there, but we got seated right away.  We were greeted warmly by someone from the bar and by our server.   \nTo start, I was torn between the french press coffee (from Blind Dog, for those who want to know) and the Mexican Mocha.  I don't think I've had Mexican Mocha before, but when the server said it's essentially mocha with a dash of cumin, I had to try it.  I liked it a lot.  It may be a tad sweet, but the heat from the cumin kinda offset it a little bit.  I had to slurp it to the very last drop because that's where all the cumin ended up.  \nThen, there's the crepe.  I love crepes.  And Creme has them, and theirs is so good!  I ordered the seasonal special savory crepe (breakfast sausage, sauteed mushroom, kale, fennel, and topped with a fried egg).  I mean...so delicious!  It had everything I wanted and needed to get me fueled up for our hike.  Hubby had the breakfast sandwich (two scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese, leeks, mushroom and your choice of meat).  It looked good, but he wasn't sharing, not even when I pulled the 'I had to taste it so I can review it on Yelp.'  Oh well, I will just have to order it when we go back.\nFinally, the service.  I liked that I could see the chefs busy themselves in the kitchen.  The place was starting to fill up, but the servers remained friendly and warm, and didn't rush us out of there, even when we offered to get up before the check came, so that they can seat the people waiting.  It just gave off this super relaxed, neighborly atmosphere.  We got the feeling that we were regulars, despite the fact that it was our first time there.  I liked that.  I liked that a lot.  I can't wait to go back!  Go give them a try!","date":"2016-02-16 06:08:48"}

They also offer cocktail options (include froses), but no brunch specials (bottomless mimosas or bloody marys) like most brunches around the area. However, what left a not so positive impression was the service. We had a brunch reservation for a party of 9 in the early afternoon of a Sunday (which was purposeful to avoid the brunch \"rush\") yet our food took ages to come out. While our server was attentive and regularly came around to refill drinks there was no mention as to why it took about 40-45 mins for all of us to receive our food when the restaurant was nearly empty. Not sure if this was a front of the house, or back of the house issue but the wait time felt excessive. Overall, I'm not sure if I'll be back, especially for brunch.","date":"2019-03-29 02:44:39"}

I won't rehash all the good things she has already mentioned. I would like to add  that I felt very comfortable walking all around this clean, mid-sized park on a Monday morning. Assorted water fowl were in both lakes. Pay attention to the many information signs. The water in the motorboat lake, Archer Lake,  is not potable and fishing is allowed only in the larger Silverbell Lake. There are groomed dirt walking trails around the lakes and around the park. Access to the asphalt paved Santa Cruz River Bikeway is located on the far side of the park, away from Silverbell Rd.  I was amazed at reading the historical facts (signage near boat ramp) about how Juan Bautista de Anza established a route, from 1774-1777, from Sonora, Mexico to found the Port of San Francisco,  in order to maintain Spain's control of these territories. The trail, the Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail, passes near the sign location. I didn't see playground equipment but families were arriving to join the many already walking, fishing, and the many dogs inside the dog park.  There appears to be a fenced section for possibly small dogs, but all the poochies I saw were getting along well, all inside the larger off-leash area.

Excellent value for money. There was sufficient choices on display for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. The fish pakoda was outstanding, the butter chicken didn't let down and the beef in the vindaloo was in beautiful perfect cubes. The naan was soft and delicious. The decor was nice, it didn't start getting filled up and it seems to be a favorite lunch place in the neighborhood.\nThe only let down was the dessert. They had cut fruits as well as some Indian fare. The Rasmalai and Kheer were good, not amazing. However I would stay away from the gulab jamun which was too dense and the jalebi which was too hard and crispy throughout.\nAnyway I'll go back for the food for sure and hope to try some more dishes on their menu on a different day.","date":"2018-10-04 19:12:59"}

I used All My Sons for a one bedroom apartment move from South Jersey to Philadelphia. First, I was told I would get a call when the movers were on their way, because they couldn't give me a time, just said I was first. Never got a call, movers just showed up. Three guys, all pleasant. Took them 8:30 to 11:15 to load items from my first apartment. I was okay with this, even though it was a little longer then estimated. Next, I drive to Philly and tell them I will meet them at the apartment. I get to the apartment at 11:45. The movers don't show up until 12:45, mind you I AM PAYING BUY THE HOUR. I was unaware that I would be paying for their lunch break! I asked what took so long, driver claimed only certain routes for trucks. It was basically going up 76, don't think that's an issue for trucks.  Unfortunately, the process to get the furniture into the new place was a mess. Took the guys 1:00 to 4:00 to unload. My entertainment center, a piece was broken off and my large mirror legs are all scratched and scuffed up from the truck. No discounts were offered. My bill was OVER $1400! I was in shock when I saw it! I wanted to cry, but just handed over my credit card. Please look elsewhere, unless you want a hefty bill and broken furniture. Honestly, I feel like I was taken advantage of, because I was a female and obviously could not complete this move by myself. Take warning, these reviews are honest. Management never called to follow up after the move to see how things went or even send a follow up email. Very disappointed and I do not want anyone else taken advantage of.","date":"2019-02-16 02:35:22"}

Easy going and casual - you order at the counter, sit down, and they'll bring out your food.  The wall mural has some cute Spanish phrases and their English translations to keep you entertained while you wait.  \n\nI had the pabellon arepa and yucca fries.  My other half had the shredded chicken with avocado.  Between the two, I definitely preferred my hot arepa and the flavors of the beef.  Savory, a little sweet, tender beef with plantains.  The cilantro mayo went well with everything (though I prefer a cilantro sauce to a mayo).  If you are new to arepas, they're not the easiest \"sandwiches\" to eat by hand so don't be surprised if you try to pick it up.  Given the presentation in a more open type of wrapper, I chose to use a fork and knife.  Also, arepas are hefty!  You wouldn't expect it to be so filling by the size of it, but it really was.  I was stuffed!  The yucca fries were tasty as well - nicely salted and the salsa it came with was pretty good.  We also had the cilantro lemonade but while it was refreshing initially, it was too sweet for us overall.  \n\nI would definitely go back to try some of the other options, especially the empanadas!

Not hot spicy but like you dumped the whole pepper shaker in.

Real peices of bacon! The garlic butter was frozen like a rock so difficult to spread and didn't add a lot to the dish in flavor.\nPortions looked great but actually we didn't end up with any leftovers at all considering we all got full orders. \nThe potato salad was loved by everyone. The potato croquettes were very good but soooo pricey. Paid an additional $5 to an already $25 dish for 5 deep fried mashed potato balls. Worth trying once but I don't think I'll get them again.

I topped it with house-made whipped cream and house-made caramel sauce. This sauce was definitely no butterscotch, definitely no imitation. This was 100% caramel sauce, thick and sticky and full of flavor and texture. It coated the bottom of my to-go container and I joyously scooped up globs of it with my spoon once I started to finish my ice cream and whipped cream.\n\nThe prices though? *phew* It cost just shy of $22 for one small and one medium to-go ice cream each with two toppings!

This occured because they had inadvertently sent four men rather than three.  And when I mentioned not feeling right about being penalized for their error, I was told that they could just leave & move on to another job.  I, however, just bit the bullet and paid the extra 60.00 an hour.  Really, I was stuck!  It was literally the last day I had to relocate!  Also, the movers broke my bedframe & fireplace, stole my drill, and showed up without masks.  I provided them masks and a drill; they were unprepared.

They also had spicy\/sweet nuts and some castelvetrano olives (which are my favorite type!)\n\nThe soup was a good tomato bisque, but by far my favorite thing was the braised beef short ribs with gnocchi, horseradish, arugula and bread crumbs. The beef was exceptionally tender and fall-apart moist. The peppery arugula went well with the creamy sauce. The breadcrumbs provided a bit of a crunch and the gnocchi was tender and fluffy. It provided a great range of textures and all the flavors worked well together. I would certainly order it again. I had a few bites of chicken parm which was impressively moist and better than I expected.

(P.s. It's actually bread pudding sliced and sautéed and served like French toast). I got the Nutella desert which was perfectly creamy and the right amount of sweet. \n\nThe cocktails were all delicious and strong. The Julietta with vanilla and ginger was a great combo.

The waitress said, oh sorry and didn't get the Brussels. I'm usually not the kind of person to make a seem if not happy with my food, unless undercooked.

Circular half-booths lined the sides of the darkened room, neon light fixtures dangled from the ceiling and hot dogs spun on wire grates at the snack bar. The bar area was relatively large and the lines moved quickly.  Although I didn't see one, and I can't imagine that there was a need for it on such a mild night, the smell of a lit fireplace filled the air.   \n\nExpecting the worst, we inquired about beer costs. That was when I heard the magical words, \"two dollar PBRs.\" Oh hellllllllls yeah! I got that party started. \n\nThe show itself far exceeded my expectations. The sound quality was great and there was plenty room to dance. The crowd was friendly and it seemed like everyone was just out to have a good time. The only issue was that the room temperature skyrocketed once everyone got moving. I felt like I was dancing in hell and at any point I might look over and see John Candy in a devil costume, laughing maniacally, from that scene in Planes, Trains & Automobiles.

I too have had many orders cancelled for no reason.  I received an email notification for each of them stating that the meds were being shipped.  After waiting a week or so I would check my account only to find out that it had been cancelled and no follow-up email sent to let me know.  And they were meds that I was already about to run out of.  My doctor would then have to resend the script and then provide me with an \"emergency\" script to hold me over until the full amount arrived.\n\nI work overseas so trying to time out receiving the prescriptions while at home is important.  On one occasion I was overseas and updated my account with a temporary address weeks in advance.  But ES sent them to my home address instead.  It took over a month for them to finally ship the meds to my overseas address.\n\nThe iPhone app they have worked for a bit and was handy.  Now I can no longer view the prescription information.  When I select the link it tells me I have no payment information.  Funny thing is I pay nothing for the prescriptions anyways.\n\nMy newest issue with them now is that when I log onto the website nothing but general information appears.  Under the Mange Your Prescriptions tab I am allowed to do a general search for medications.  A good feature if I wanted to look up a random med but nothing that shows my prescriptions or order history.  The only information that pertains to me is My Account information.  This is simply my contact email address, phone number, home address and that general type of information.\n\nAs I mentioned I pay nothing for the prescriptions I have with Express Scripts.  They were great in the beginning but are worthless now.  I am done with them and will just pay out of pocket from here on out.

(Price wasn't too bad for duck)\n\nShrimp Risotto -$28.75 = Shrimp, Black-Eyed Peas, Green Tomato Relish, Chipotle Cream - Tasty and good! good size shrimp (maybe a little overpriced)\n\nThe Meridian Burger-$22.50 = Gruyere Cheese, Dewig Bacon, Onion Ring, Tomato Marmalade, Garlic Mayo, Fries - Delicious and very juicy burger for sure... but $23 for ANY burger seems too high!\n\nDessert of Mini Cinnamon Sugar Donuts-$7.75 = Malted Coffee Cream - suggested to us from the server, and through we considered passing on dessert, glad we went with this option, freshly made and hot donuts with this coffee cream were fantastic!\n\nOver all, all food items were DELICIOUS with fantastic mixes of flavors that complemented the others wonderfully!! Service was very attentive and good.\nBUT our cons were 1. not child friendly and 2. price seems a bit high... yes the food was amazing but I would have to say I have had comparable meals at lower prices around Indy! If prices were a little more comparable, I may be back more often!!","date":"2014-03-09 20:07:41"}

I've been extremely stressed and was very much looking forward to this massage in advance of the holidays. I'm willing to bet if I had cancelled with 6 hours notice, I would have had to pay a cancellation fee. You should always have staff on call for situations like this. And I was set to become a member and everything! No thank you.\n\n***UPDATE: Since posting this review, they have reached out several times, including TEXTING ME. I did not give anyone from this business permission to text me. Since when is this OK?\n\nThis is the opposite kind of service I would expect from a business that promotes relaxation and wellness. I told them over the phone when they initially cancelled that I would go elsewhere for my massage, and they continue to call\/text me and invade my privacy. This is very poor behavior from a business.\n\nAnother update: \n\nThis business continues to text (again, without my permission), and at this point made it clear that they are only doing so because I've left a Yelp review. \n\nA couple hours after they cancelled my appointment, I received an appointment reminder. Yes! They had the audacity to remind me of the appointment that they cancelled. I called after receiving the reminder to confirm that they did, indeed, cancel my appointment. Yet, the appointment is still reflected in their scheduling software. \n\nI'm really appreciative of the emotional distress they're causing me (a stressed pregnant lady), when the whole reason I made appointment there in the first place is to try to relieve stress.

Dr. Kinsey performed the surgery and I have to say she was absolutely amazing. She was very informative and definitely took her time to explain everything in detail. She kept us in the loop through our dogs entire stay and even answered questions for us after our dogs discharge. Fast forward to this past week. Our dog has needed yet another surgery for intervertebral disc disease. The first vet that saw us suggested we go to university of penn or another facility for our dog to be evaluated. Thankfully she reached out to Dr. Kinsey because once again, Dr. Kinsey comes to the rescue and walks me through the benefits\/risks of the procedure. Due to the amount of information she provided, I was able to make an educated decision. My disappointment has not been with the medical care my fur baby has received, but with support staff. I never received a call from anyone telling me my dog was out of recovery. Now mind you, I don't need a call from Dr. Kinsey every time. Just some update would've been nice. I have a daughter in college and a husband who was away waiting for updates. I had nothing to give them. I ended up on hold for over an hour before I got in the car and had to actually drive to the facility and request and update. The woman who I spoke to was very apologetic and requested the doctor come speak to me. While I waited I heard one of receptionists tell another client that they could not accommodate a quality of life visit for an apparent very sick cat. The receptionist was not private about the conversation and she was matter of fact. It absolutely broke my heart to watch this woman walk out the door with a cat that she didn't know what to do with. Heart wrenching. As a business owner, I'm careful to write negative reviews. What really upset me was my last interaction with the support staff. One the third night of my pets stay, I called for an update. Once again, I was on hold for over an hour. Had to drive up again. This time I had to interact with the same receptionist that sent the woman with the sick cat out the door. I will be honest, I wasn't as thrilled having to drive up there a second time for an update so I was not in a great mood, but she acted as though she couldn't be bothered and that I was an inconvenience for being concerned for my dog. She told me to have a seat then yelled across the waiting room that the doctor would call me. The doctor did call and I did receive an update. My frustration really boils down to how much this facility has taken on. They're not handling the volume well. Dr. Kinsey obviously works very hard and has very long days. I don't fault her. I fault the owners for not seeing this and making necessary changes. The owners in my opinion are making themselves look greedy and continue to grow a business that is obviously very short handed. I wish I could believe this was COVID related but two years ago it was the same. You cannot be an animal hospital, pharmacy, mobile practice and a regular veterinarians office and properly triage all patients and give them the care they need. I wouldn't go to the ER for sore throat or for a vaccine but yet this is what they are doing for our pets. The entire operation has to be revamped. How about live wait times on the website? Separating the hospital from regular well visits. Specific medication pick up times. Staff training for how to properly interact with clients. When you spend $9800 you don't want to pushed away as an inconvenience and that's just what happened. As for the girl at the front desk with the tattoos and red hair, she doesn't belong at the front desk as the face of your company. She obviously doesn't respect your clients. I have a hard time believing it was just me or the woman with the cat that she treated the way she did. I've now spent approximately 17k at this establishment and it is extremely disheartening to be treated like crap by support staff especially considering the amount of money I've spent. Dr. Kinsey is and has been amazing! Owners, you need to figure out what direction you want to go and give it 100%. This Jack of all trades operation isn't working. Feel free to call me. No need to ask me to email you. I've given you enough information in this review that I know you can figure out just who I am, so you can contact me to resolve the issue!","date":"2021-10-20 11:05:13"}

Yes I waited to post a review as I contacted Fellini's first and wanted to give the owner or manager a chance to rectify the issue but no one made any attempt to contact me OR make the situation right.\nIt was Veteran's day when we went to Fellini's with my brother who is a vet and he specifically chose this establishment. We went with his wife, myself, him, and my three nephews.\nWhen we arrived we saw that there was a large party of about 30 people that were on one half of the restaurant. I didn't think this would be an issue with our service or food quality but it was.\nFirst the server took our bottles of wine from the table for around 20 minutes until we flagged down another server to retrieve our bottles. I don't know why they were taken off the table in the first place and not opened in front of us right away but we let that go.\nWe ordered the calamari appetizer, 2 seafood medley's, a penne dish, and for the kids grilled chicken with a side of pasta and a chicken cutlet for my nephew.\nThe calamari took over 45 minutes to arrive and was poorly plated, no side salad was on the dish (which the dish always comes with), and tasted greasy and was all tentacles and no rings. Very disappointing.\nThe kids food arrived with the appetizer. My nephew loved his grilled chicken but let me emphasize that it was two very thin pieces of chicken and a small side of pasta. We were charged a whopping $19 which would have been fine if this dish was adult portions but it was not. My other nephew had a few pieces of chicken cutlet on a plate and the cost was also $19 and it wasn't an adult portion. If you don't offer kid meals then the least you could do is give the kids adult portion to justify the cost.\nOur 3 meals for the adults didn't arrive for an hour after the appetizer. It was ridiculous. We received no apology for the wait in food. If you can not be properly staffed when you have a large party in the restaurant then you should close the restaurant for the party.\nMy sister and I were served the seafood medley which we normally love despite the $35 cost because it's delicious and loaded with seafood. It wasn't this time. The dish had cold crab meat on top, no shrimp or calamari as mentioned in the description and just a few clams and mussels. \nWhen the bill arrived, my sister tried to nicely speak with the manager who couldn't care less about our concerns, horrible service, and being overcharged. After being in the restaurant for close to 3 hours, the kids were miserable and we were all ready to leave. I will never return to this restaurant. Had the manager or owner contacted me a few weeks ago, I could have overlooked this experience and been back.\nI've worked in the restaurant industry for over ten years so I am sympathetic to the struggles of the wait staff, chef, and pleasing customers but anytime I've had a bad experience at a restaurant the owner has always made it right. The manager\/owner here didn't even care to respond to my email or give me a call.\nDo better.

I'd still go back though, the sausage was legit Italian sausage and the cheese, sauce, and seasonings were all spectacular.","date":"2021-12-05 23:42:30"}

The price was reasonable but not really a great deal considering the food and service.\nI ordered the Basil Noodles with level 2 spiciness (\"zesty\") but the seasoning was very uneven.

The rice was exceptionally bland (cooked without even a pinch of salt?). The naan, although small, was surprisingly the best part of the meal.\nBecause establishments are having difficulties hiring staff, I try to be more tolerant of slow service and staffing shortages. However, when I walked into Rice, there was one inside diner, an outside table with customers, and one patron in the bar. The only visible staff was the bartender. In the apx. 15 min. it took for the hostess to come out of the kitchen with another to-go order, three more people came in behind me and the bartender, with his one customer, never acknowledged or even looked at us.

The meat,  was little bits and pieces like they scraped up the bottom of the tray they keep it in, and it was bland.. The cheese was skinned over on top and the sandwich, was not hot at all. I told the waitress and she said she'll mention it to the cook. That was it, no mention of remaking the sandwiches. The beer was good. I wouldn't go back, wasn't worth 36.00 for those sandw iches.

The shrimp pil pil is more like an appetizer but an amazing one. you get shrimp soaked in wine, butter, and herbs with a baguette to eat with. The flavor is amazing! The mushroom dish surprised me. I was expecting little mushrooms or just the cheap kind but they had large chunks of good mushroom. The sauce had a little heat and it was fantastic.

As if that isn't area is dope enough, the actual inside is even more popping. Just check out the bathroom you won't regret it! I think we tried every cocktail there, fabrika spritz being my favorite but they were all decent. For apps we had the octopus, the pork belly, the burrata and the bolognese. I wasn't crazy about the burrata, but the rest were outstanding. The pork belly melted in my mouth, you could taste the freshness of the homemade pasta. Although the bolognese is not a standard appetizer it is a must try!  I may have enjoyed the potatoes more than the octopus. For entrees we \"family styled\" it as usual. Lamb chops, shrimp risotto and flank steak. The lamb had great flavor, the mashed potatoes had flawless consistency and the risotto with the shrimp was just wow! The risotto with the shrimp was much better than the risotto that was served with the lamb chops.The steak itself was pretty good but not as good as the lamb chops. The menu has already changed since my visit a month ago and I believe they're open inside so I cannot wait to try again. The server even let us try some homemade peanut butter ice cream the pastry chef was experimenting with !!! I'm excited to go back, eat inside and see what lm sure will be fabulous show.

There are some interesting creations like The Volcano which is what I ordered. An upside down fried taco shell with boiled shrimp inside, crab salad on top, drizzled with at least two Asian style sauces, and throw in some seared tuna for good measure. This thing is a beast. The best part about it was actually the seared tuna. This as actually something they are famous for having won awards at the Oak Street Po-Boy festival for a seared tuna po-boy as well as a couple other exotic creations. Even after polishing off this giant plate and tasting off other plates at the table, I still had to order the dessert. The fried bread pudding was fantastic.

No greeting, no smile, nothing. Literally she looked at me and said \"11.99\" (the price lol)\n\nAnyways, I almost never recieve this kind of service here. It was a dead thursday evening and I just imagined this crap service to be a great metaphor of how the light of summer is fading into the darkness. Well played Aspen Leaf. \n\nWe love this place though. The froyo is the best in the valley, actually scratch that... in the world. I spent 3 summers working for my aunt at TCBY in Wyoming so basically I'm an expert. \n\nSome froyo I've tried is really watery or has this weird lumpy texture but Aspen Leaf's froyo taste way better than any yogurt or ice cream I've ever tried. They've turned Baskin Robins into the illegitimate love child of frozen desserts. We only visit them twice a year. Meanwhile we spend most our summer nights at Aspen Leaf. \n\nOne year in the fall they had this salted caramel corn flavored froyo. I was like a crack addict with that stuff. I think i would go weekly for pints. It was amazing. They always have good flavors and mix it up. \n\nPro-tip: Tuesdays you get double punches.","date":"2018-09-07 02:18:42"}

I had never been to a full-fledged vegan restaurant before Mesa Verde, but let me just say...it left me speechless. My boyfriend and I shared the polenta fries to start, and it was one of the most immaculate dishes I've ever tasted. Sometimes you try a dish and you immediately know that the chef has a sixth sense about how flavors and textures mesh and mingle. This was one of those dishes. Do NOT miss the polenta fries. \n\nFor our mains, I had the empanadas and Derek had the impossible burrito. Both dishes were just...wow. The flavor profiles of MV's dishes are simply on a higher plane than I'm used to consuming. I don't know what I was expecting, but this is cuisine-as-art. It was also very obvious that they used very fresh ingredients as all of the dishes tasted wonderfully bright and herbaceous. \n\nWe shared a chocolate cake for dessert, and it was just as stellar as the first three dishes. I just wish I could remember more specifically what was in it, but it made me incredibly happy.\n\nThere is a common misconception among meat-eaters (my past self included) that a vegetarian\/vegan dish could never provide the same level of savory satisfaction that a meat dish does. This notion is simply false. I encourage any self-proclaimed carnivore to come here with an open mind and see if you don't agree. \n\nBonus points: this place is way more affordable than it could be, and I'm so grateful for that.

Here's a list of the things I tried:\n\n-Raw Oysters.  These were some of the best raw oysters I've had since living in Louisiana.  Perfect taste and texture, and they serve them the right way, on ice.  It drives me crazy when places just serve oysters on a plate with a paper towel on it (looking at you, ACME).  Yes, these were awesome.  \n\n-Chargrilled Oysters.  These were good, but not as good as Drago's.  Either they were too oily, too buttery, or something.  They were covered in cheese, but didn't have that great smokey flavor I've come to expect from Drago's.  They were good, however, and I would definitely eat them again.  \n\n-Seafood Gumbo: This was disappointing. Even with the addition of lots of Tobasco, still kind of blah.  \n\n-Pomegranite Mojito: The Superior group gets one thing right everytime: the drinks.  With this place, I can start happy hour with pomegranite mojitos, then go for a drunk walk\/street car ride down St. Charles to get one of their top shelf margaritas at the flagship that Yelpers love so much (kidding).  This drink was sweet but not too sweet, and was very strong.  It paired perfectly with the oysters.  \n\nThe atmosphere this place is going for is Parisian Cafe, which is kind of confusing since TVs are everywhere, instead of just limited to the bar area.  The service was efficient and friendly enough.   SO SO happy to have a place to get oysters all different ways uptown.","date":"2012-02-10 18:52:54"}

Among the people I am fortunate enough to call friends is Sari A, who introduced me to one of the most fun experiences I've had doing something pretty ordinary:  Combining brunch with  a Drag Queen show.  That is the joy that is L'Etage's Drag Queen Brunch.  \n\nFirst,understand, I love drag queens.  Drag is a celebration of women, of art, of creativity, and of being not only who you are but who you wish you could be.  Look at my profile pics and you'll see one of me with Hedda Lettuce, one of the great queens I've had the privilege of seeing perform.\n\nSo when Sari asked about a Drag Queen Brunch, I was definitely in.  \n\nL'Etage is just off South Street,  a little off the beaten path but not much.  The show happens on the second floor.  I arrived and was ushered to Sari's table - a long half-oval shape with banquette against the window and tall chairs facing.  We had a great view of the stage floor.  \n\nWe were offered drinks and happily chatted as some of the Queens came out pre-show to mingle and chat.  They were great, happily being both sassy and friendly, I even got a couple of makeup tips that have turned out quite well. Want to know how to accentuate your best features?  Talk to a good Queen.\n\nThen, the show - OMG was it fun. Singing, dancing, even splits were to be had and for the first time ever I saw a Drag Queen Puppet\/Ventriloquist act.  It was wonderful\n\nFood was...fine.  I had the strawberry compote stuffed french toast with vanilla cream.  It was...fine. A little chewy, and not as much interesting flavors as I had hoped.  Then again, I didn't come there because of the cuisine.  It's all about the show.\n\nThe Queens love tips, so I brought plenty of $1 bills which they happily come to collect as they perform.  I was even able to get change for a $20 from a Queen from all her $1 bills later.   She was happy to reduce her stash, and of course some of it was coming right back to her and her fellow performers. It's what you call a win-win.  \n\nThat brings me to my sole gripe of the show: The staff.  Invisible, irregular, and kind of bitchy. During intermission I saw I was low on tips and so I did my best to find a server or bartender who could help me get change.  No takers, and the bartender was kind of nasty about it too.  I was surprised and disappointed as I would have thought the restaurant was well aware of all the tipping and would be prepared to help people spend their money.   After all, the Queens are going to perform when they are tipped, and the Queens are bringing folks to the restaurant, and the folks are buying drinks and food.  Duh.  That's the 1-star off. Service, people, and even if you can't help someone, don't be an ass.  \n\nOverall it was a blast, afterwards I got to chat with some of the Queens some more as we exited, and it was wonderful.  They loved that I am quite comfortable with others' preferences even if they aren't my own. In the end, love is love.  I got hugs and a few more tips on makeup and dress too. :) \n\nIf you like drag, go.  It's not the naughtiest show you'll see - it is after all a Sunday morning - but it's tons of fun.  Thanks, Sari.  You're the best.","date":"2018-10-08 10:19:25"}

I said absolutely and based on your yelp review, I'd like to talk to you about organizing a room in my basement and for regular cleaning of my home.  She informed me that she would call me right back and when asked if she had my phone number, she told me that she did.  That was at 11:51 AM EST today.\n\nIt is now 6:50 PM EST almost 7 hours later and no call.\n\nThis initial impression has left me quite convinced that this is not the company I want to do any business with and I feel it's noteworthy to review my experience.","date":"2013-04-22 22:52:02"}

It's street parking but that wasn't a big deal for that afternoon.  It's probably the most polished of the breweries as you walk up.  A nice porch (with a ramp) where you can sit and watch the traffic on Tchoupitoulas.  Inside, there was plenty of comfortable seating.  Lots of TVs scattered around; I counted 6 of them.  I started with the Slack Water brown ale which was a good beer, if you are into brown ales.  Continuing to explore their beers, I followed that with the Storyville IPA.  It wasn't quite to my taste, but then that's why they have a half dozen or so beers on tap, something for everyone.  I fibnished the afternoon with the Tea Pale Ale.

First thing we noticed after being seated is the vents from the air condition are blowing down directly in the row against the wall. It was very drafty, cold and uncomfortable even though the places décor seemed nice. We had to button up our tops and jackets.\n\nWe ordered: Shared the appetizers and one burger with fries.\nCrispy Calamari-  they where good and light.\n\nHoney Bay Wing Bites-  the chicken was good but there was something off on the sauce on top of them besides being to sweet, it had a bad side taste to it. Blue cheese dressing was ok.\n.\nPub Burger- had a good flavor and was cooked right like we ordered medium the bun was also very soft. \nIt came with French fries which arrived cold and soggy I guess it comes from the vessel that they put them in a little bucket, looks nice but makes them soggy since they are piled into them. They should consider removing this from their presentation. We let the waitress know that they where soggy and cold, received a new batch with the same issue they just get soggy period. We like our fries warm and crispy. We never received our ketchup that we asked for had to get it from another table ourselves.\n\nThis is the biggest issue I have with\" Roots\" they have a good beer menu and offer cocktails and wine and they are all listed on the menu in the restaurant and online.\n\nWhere is the menu for NON-ALCOHOLIC DRINKS????? \n\nThey do not let their patrons know about what they have to offer is it Coke is it Pepsi? Do they have lemonade or Ice tea??? I checked online as well they do not even list any non-alcoholic drinks. WTH seriously you should consider adding these onto your menu as I can tell you this is not very customer service friendly. I don't favor having to ask for what you have on non-alcoholic drinks I get you sell beer I can see that by your long nice bar etc.\n\nThey do have a nice side outside seating area with plenty of seating that we will try out.\n\nOverall the atmosphere is nice the service needs to be a little more attentive and follow up on your patrons especially bring the ketchup if someone asks for it please. Food is good with little  tweaks it will be better.\n\nOn a side note ROOTS should consider updating their computers to reflect the actual name of the restaurant!!! \nAfter receiving the check we noticed that it says \" Guppy's 2\" as the name, seems that its a quick fix but you are called ROOTS last time I checked right.","date":"2017-04-19 16:49:40"}

Literally the first and sometimes only flavor I could get from several items! The ranchero sauce on the chiles, the refried beans, the guacamole.. everything was too salty for me. To be fair, I am very sensitive to salty foods. But to be more fair, I don't think many people would have disagreed with my assessment. Also our table chips weren't particularly fresh, but far from being not tasty.\n\nI still give you four stars, Plaza Azteca.

A potentially better spot is the newly renovated Bourse, but RTM has some things going for it. On my recent visit, I grabbed a buttery Miller's Twist warm pretzel, Hope's cookies from the Pennsylvania General Store and a cookie from 4th Street cookie company, and a tiramisu cake and biscotti from Termini Brother's bakery. All of these were good. My taste test (albeit of different types of cookies) leads me to give a slight nod to 4th Street's macadamia chocolate chip cookie (the healthier looking Harvest cookie - cranberries, oats, cinnamon - at Hope's was actually kind of greasy). That said I like the selection at Hope's as well as their signature peanut butter chocolate dipped cookies. \nMy one disappointing experience with RTM was the Dutch Eating Place's open face turkey sandwich. Not sure how this got positive reviews - the plain white bread was drowned in gravy that coated excessive turkey - so much unappetizing food! I've had their delicious apple dumplings in the past (so I know they offer some good items); Stick with their breakfast\/desserts.

The Scene: Two miles of smooth and easy walking paths suitable for the young 'uns and the geriatric in all of us, not counting the side treks, like the aviary, the hummingbird aviary and the cave.  Around two acres of natural - or man-made-to-look-very-natural scenery carved out of the Arizonan desert.  The rocks in all large animal enclosures are made from concrete but shaped to resemble the animal's natural habitat.  You won't see no wolf sharing a pen with a stuffed toy version of himself here.\n\nAn awesome exhibit of the Arizonan flora.  You'll be amazed at the variety of cacti and how some of them are comparable to the most exquisite orchids.\n\n2.  The Facilities: Keeping in mind that the clientele may be of the urinally-challenged and easily-tired set, restrooms, drinking fountains, and benches can be found throughout the park.  Benches are thoughtfully located underneath large mesquite trees.  Some of the restrooms even have sunscreen in a pump.  That's right...SUNSCREEN IN A BIG PUMP, in case you thought you were in Seattle and have no need for the stuff in Tucson.  Water fountains are also equipped with a \"water bottle\" refilling station.  \n\nSide note -- the blueberry muffins at the cafe were not petrified, like the fossilized remains of animals found in the Arizonan desert centuries ago, but some of the largest and moistest I've ever tasted.  At premium prices, of course.\n\n3.  The Learning: If you're like me - whose memories of school year field trips involve falling asleep at the planetarium and drooling all over yourself, trying to sneak a bag of potato chips into a Japanese tea ceremony, putting a bra over the head of the animals on display at the natural history museum - then one trip to the Sonora Desert Museum will absolve you of all those past transgressions.  \n\nThe museum never passes up an opportunity to educate visitors young and old.  The entrance of the aviary has a stack of colored, laminated cards explaining each of the bird species inhabiting the enclosure.  Another outdoor exhibit details the flora found at different elevations of the Arizona desert.  Well-informed docents set up tables full of fossils and tools throughout the day, in front of key animal exhibits.  Each animal enclosure even has a little table with a stamp of the paw print of the animal on display for kiddies.  There's also a GPS app through your phone, which will explain each area you visit.\n\n4.  The Animals - ...were all well-taken care of.  None of the animals were clanging their metal cups against the bars of their cage (there are no bars on any cages, except for the fowl), no looks of desperation in their eyes, or pacing back and forth chewing on an old cigarette butt.  The animals all looked healthy, looked alert and well-fed.\n\nDon't miss the Raptor flight, held twice a day, during which 4 or 5 Harris Hawks are released among gawking visitors, then prey upon small children and the elderly...actually, no.  There's no preying but watching the huge hawks in flight is a pretty amazing experience.\n\nWe spent 6 blistering-feet, sun drenched happy hours here and will be back later in the season to see the cacti bloom.  Highly HIGHLY recommended stop for anyone who truly appreciates the beauty of the Arizonan desert.","date":"2014-01-20 21:28:11"}

And, the hourly rate changed to $175\/hour to add a 3rd mover, which I can get that, but again, this should have been all laid out in preparation.\nMy family member called the manager to figure out why everything is different and why nothing was told in advance. He was absolutely horrid, would not let her get one word in. Seriously, managers are supposed to listen, then respond, and not just managers, this is how actual capable and respectful adults communicate. She became so frustrated that he would not even listen for one second, she just had to cancel everything. Who could blame her? Why would we give our business to a company that literally can't be professional in the least and are so miserable rude and awful? The fact we could just cancel without a deposit lost or anything shows how unprofessional this company is.\nI take time to call him back. Again, would not even let me get a full question out. I had to spend time getting him to just stop talking for one second in the most frustrating conversation ever. I said, like adults I need you to listen and take turn speaking so we may communicate. He says he doesn't have to let us know about being charged $1300, we all know that's ridiculous. He also said things change on site based on apartment level and distance, etc etc. I said, A competent company would have asked all these questions when they were making the booking and that changes on site are unacceptable unless notified in advance by circumstance. He didn't actually listen to anything, just continued to be defensive and argue. The worst, most infuriating manager, and adult man, I've ever tried to talk to and am so grateful we didn't actually work with this company.\nI told him it was a blessing in the end because we were able to find a different company on short notice that ended up being more affordable, profession, and kind. And wouldn't you know, they called and asked all the proper questions and gave all the information necessary to be fully prepared. No 4 figure amount necessary to be charged in advance, either.\nHighly do not recommend ever.","date":"2021-12-30 18:41:44"}

First, I did read the reviews before I decided to go back and I chose to take the reviews under advisement to manage my expectations, because I wanted to us my last Groupon (I purchased a 3-pack) and I had positive past experiences. Lastly, Ms. Ruby is a very sweet girl who revealed she had only been doing this for a few months, and I just didn't have the heart to raise a stink about the end results in front of  her co-worker. I also don't want her to be discouraged from learning and perfecting her craft, but I  won't be back. It's just too painful a process to pay to be someone test dummy. \nI feel I have a responsibility to other consumers to give fair warning of what you should expect if you choose to patronize this business for waxing services (that's the only perspective I can speak from). So here it goes:\n\nMost painful experience EVER, not because it was the first time in a long time but because of the methods used. She used the same type of wax for the entire process which required going over the same area more than once or twice. She wore rubber gloves that may have been too big for her hands because they also stuck to the wax in my very sensitive areas and needed to be pulled from unwaxed areas (twice the pain).  The process was slow and painful. To Ruby's credit, she is very engaging and kept me talking but, I was definitely praying for it to end soon. \nWhen it was all done and I was cleaning up the wax, there were spots that I still had to cut strands of hair from and there was no smooth feel. Some areas felt shaved instead of waxed, so I know the hair was not fully removed, and I will have to worry about ingrown hairs and bumps. \n\nRuby, if you're reading this, you need more practice, honey. You're a sweet girl who would have no problem retaining customers if you were also excellent at this, and I believe you have great potential. \n\nTo potential clients, proceed with caution... If you do decide to utilize Ruby's services, at the very least you'll be greeted with a smile and a very pleasant and engaging young lady.","date":"2020-11-14 22:41:52"}

I could eat that every day! The \"buffalo\" chicken sandwich was a really tasty crunchy big chicken breast on same fab bun, but spice was pretty mild. The sauce was a thin aioli with red cabbage that turned it pink! It was good, but not unusual.\nThe burger came with fries, but I upgraded to truffle fries. Do this! Everytime. Thin crispy perfect fries with a savory oil drizzle and plenty of parm cheese, they were a knockout (And I am not a big fry person). We also had an order of fried pickles which had a very thin and crispy batter and nice ranch dipping sauce. Not too salty or greasy like some fried pickles. Very good.

After we arrived she decided that she wanted a poke bowl instead of ramen.

I could've eaten them for days! \n \nNow for the poke. The list of items for the poke bowls is quite extensive and, if you've never ordered a bowl before, can be a bit intimidating. Lucky for us, we had an amazing waiter who patiently assisted us with some of our selections. I ordered my fish and veggies over a bed of warm rice but you can also have it served or greens if you prefer to. On top of the multitude of various fresh veggies and accoutrements (wonton chips, fried garlic, lemon slices, fried onions, sesame seeds, etc) you get to choose from a variety of several sauces. Choose one or choose them all. I picked a spicy mayo and a citrus ponzu type of sauce. The fish was so fresh, the veggies cold and crisp, the sauces were the bomb, bowl was epic! The large bowl was enough for my dinner and leftover lunch the next day. My only dilema now is which amazing entree to get next time: the amazing ramen or the unbelievable poke!","date":"2021-10-04 00:38:09"}

The front desk agent told me that I was booked in a \"presidential suite\" so I was excited to get up to my room.  When I did get up to my room it was not a presidential suite but was a standard two room suite that had very old and worn furniture, worn carpet and generally needed updating. The televisions were very small and old. When I went to open the curtains of the room the view that I had was of the roof of the hotel and the windows were absolutely filthy!  It was difficult to even clearly see out of them.

I love the vibe and the fact that Maplewood finally has an ice cream shop! However, for someone who advertises vegan options, per their website, they only have two vegan\/dairy-free options on their menu, and often (possibly always), only one of those flavors is offered on any given day. As someone with a severe dairy allergy, those two options are the only ones I can consume; making trips to Boardwalk with my husband or friends a hit-or-miss experience. If the available flavor is one I'm not a fan of, or if it is out for the day, I find myself forced to choose between missing out on time with friends, or going with them, only to sit and watch them eat ice cream (which I LOVE) with nothing in front of me-- which is sadly reminiscent of my past, decades-long struggle with anorexia. I would LOVE for them to have more vegan\/dairy-free options, or at least to have both available daily. \n\nPersonal Opinion on Vegan\/Dairy-Free Options:\n\nMocha Cookie Crumble: \nI LOVE THIS FLAVOR! Seriously, probably the best dairy-free ice cream I've ever had! I am a sucker for coffee-flavored ice cream, and the mocha ice cream pairs incredibly well with the chocolate ribbons and cookie crumbles. \nKeep in mind, this ice cream has a STRONG mocha\/coffee flavor, so if you're not a fan of coffee or coffee-flavored desserts, this one is not for you. \n\nLemon Poppyseed:\nI am not a fan. Typically I love lemon desserts, but this one just didn't do it for me. In my opinion, it was more creamy than tart, and the coconut milk just didn't pair well with the light lemon flavor. \n\nAgain, both of these are my personal opinions.

One of the garlic cloves I opened up was half rotten.  The bag of mini sweet peppers I opened the next day had 2 peppers in it starting to rot.  I was going to buy parsnips, but all the bags in the store looked like were starting to rot.  The organic section is about 2 feet wide, and if you want something organic besides carrots, celery, lemons or limes you're out of luck.  The rest of the veggies I got (broccoli, tomatoes, onion, carrots) are ok - not rotten but pretty bland and tasteless.  Some of the in-season fruit is ok.  The grapes, blueberries and cherries aren't spectacular, but are pretty fresh and tasty.  But beyond that, ick.\n\nThe rest of the store is small with limited selection.  I can be a somewhat picky shopper (spoiled by Trader Joes, Wegmans, etc.) but this is pretty bad.  No organic or nitrate-free packaged deli meat.  No raw nuts.  Part of this is just that it's a small store so there's limited shelf space.  But I left without several items I came for just b\/c they didn't carry them or anything similar.\n\nIf I was going for dry goods, or other non-produce items, this store might get 2-2.5 stars.

While Moo Dang doesn't live up to some of my other favorite Thai Places, it is still very good.\n\n\nFood:\n\nBoth times I have had their food it has been very tasty.\n\nFresh summer rolls with tofu - I loved the fact that they used healthier types of lettuce and the cilantro sauce it came with was different, un-expectant but very tasty. My only complain was that the Spring roll were very loosely packed and I wasn't crazy about the minced tofu in it. I much prefer the tradition tofu strips. \n\nGreen Curry with Tofu - OK this dish has no faults, it is truly delicious! Rich creamy coconut base with delectable curry seasoning and fresh vegetables that have been cooked perfectly! NOM! NOM! This is a just a great dish!\n\n5 Star Level Spicy Kra-Pow! Spicy Basil with Tofu - I love the nontraditional tofu they used in this stir fry, typically Thai restaurants use extra firm tofu, but this was a medium firm to firm tofu -the result was a creamer texture that was a heavenly contrast to the 5 Star Spicy level I ordered. The herbs and vegetables are super fresh and were cooked perfectly, only wish they used more! The dish was onion heavy, I love onions but I always feel restaurants use onions as filler to make the dish look larger -less onion more green beans please :)  Also, while the 5 Star spicy level was spicy, if 5 is suppose to be their hottest, I would say the 5 Star Spicy Level was really about a 3.5 spicy level. \n\nBrown Rice - They use a super good quality rice and it was cooked perfectly: fluffy, firm but not crunchy, and not at all soggy or sticky!\n\n Sticky Rice with Mango - Rice was sweet and cooked perfectly, mango was fresh. HOWEVER, they didn't serve it with the traditional creamy coconut milk sauce that I am accustomed to and that I love :( rather it came with a citrus flavored sauce it wasn't bad but I didn't really love it. Keep everything else but replace that sauce with the traditional  creamy coconut milk sauce and you'd have a great dish!\n\n***That said*** I would also like to state that I wish they had more vegetarian and vegan dishes.... they are noticeably short in comparison to other Thai restaurants in the area. I know they said they would modify dishes for vegan and vegetarians, but some dishes just can't be modified e.g. meat skewers. \n\nAlso their portion sizes both times I have been there, are noticeably smaller than other local Thai restaurants. We went there for a dinner and I have had larger portions served to me during lunch specials at other Thai restaurants. \n\n\n\nService:\n\nService was friendly, prompt, and professional. No complaints. \n\n\n\nPricing: \n\nI already mentioned the noticeably smaller portion sizes in the Food section, so I won't repeat it here.\n \nAlso, while I realize some people may like Moo Dang's pricing plan, I personally loathe when restaurants charge extra for sides that 95% of people are going to order. People eat rice and noodles with asian entrees, RICE IS A STAPLE! When I see a staple item with an extra charge, I automatically start sing Les Miserable's song, Master of the House ...\"Charge 'em for the lice! Extra for the mice! Two percent for looking in the mirror twice!\" and it makes me cranky. I feel staples should be included with the meal and charge a little more so the total price covers the cost of the rice and it's preparation! Soooooo therefore (in my opinion) any non-noodle dish should automatically include the rice. Brown rice can be extra and if someone doesn't want the rice, maybe offer a discount. \n\nAlso charging the same amount for tofu as you do for beef is ridiculous! I can go to Costco and purchase a month's supply of tofu for me for under $6.00! Moreover the time cooking tofu is far less than cooking meat! NUTSHELL: Tofu is NOT anywhere as expensive as beef! \n\n\n\nCleanliness and Decor:\n\nWhile I prefer nicer decor environments, I can get over the simple, 'cheaper', and non matching color scheme of the decor of Moo Dang. However, there is no excuse in my book for a lack of cleanliness. Please wipe down the vinyl booth seats! Every booth in my eye site had seats with food spots. An 5 extra minutes max a night in cleaning would remove this problem. Also, your bathroom needed a scrub down and remove some of the clutter. \n\n\n\nYelp Check In Offer:\n\nFried Fish Balls -thanks but NO THANKS! said the vegetarian Yelper, please offer something for non meat eaters!","date":"2016-08-06 15:48:22"}

It needs improvement. So far, all my experiences have been good with it. It's not near my house, but as a segway between my home and working downtown, it helped a lot when I would bike to it near UMC and catch it (bikes allowed on-board) and ride it downtown. It's fast, and pretty efficient, and runs every 10 minutes or so depending on the scheduled time of day. It is never crowded, which worries me. Sun Tran is often crowded and standing room only. But then, Sun Tran covers all of Tucson, and Sun Link only has a certain radius. They need to offer more options for riders other than day passes. It's nice if you have a Sun Tran pass like I do, so I use that. But it seems mostly useful to UA students and some downtown folk. I can see great uses if I lived near the area. I just can't find a lot of advantage to the link myself. It's clean, comfy, safe. I enjoy it. I'll use it when I can. Just, not that often. I hope more people are using it, however.

We ordered a box of 6 and I was a little disappointed that the specialty flavors were pricey (I think around $2-2.50). The flavors we tried were cinnamon, vanilla, strawberry, lavender, milk chocolate, and pumpkin spice latte.\n\nThe donuts were all made of the same type of batter, so when I sampled a bit of each, they all started to taste indistinguishable. The only notable flavor I tried was the milk chocolate. It had a bit of chocolate crumble on top. \n\nThe real star of the show at Federal Donuts, in my opinion, is the fried chicken sandwich. This was delicious!!! The patty was juicy, and the bread complimented it well. I also tried their  1\/2 order of fried chicken with the Za'atar flavoring. Spices were great, but flavor was overly salty. Size of chicken was very small, and expensive for the $9 we paid. However, the chicken order came with a plain donut, which was nice. It tasted great later warmed up.\n\nOverall, glad I got to try Federal Donuts, but it didn't blow me away. If I went again, I'd just get one donut, not a whole box. +Get the fried chicken if you have extra $$.","date":"2015-12-02 23:00:15"}

My friend received his watch back several weeks later looking brand new and the salesperson, Darrin Cody (also the assistant manager) could not have been more helpful and kind.  On that trip I noticed a pair of opal earrings set in gold with small diamonds.  I have been looking for gold earrings for awhile and I had never purchased expensive jewelry before.  I thought about the earrings all summer and when I returned to DeVons in September, I decided to buy the earrings and the pendant that matched.  Darrin again was our salesperson and he discounted the earrings and pendant, gave us jewelry cleaner, boxes and cases.  I loved the earrings and pendant and Darrin told me to wear them and enjoy them, which I did.  A short time later, the chain for the pendant broke and I thought I lost the pendant, however, my friend found the pendant, but the chain was lost.  I called Darrin and he said to come to the store and although he would be on vacation, he would leave a chain for me.  He left two so I could choose which one I preferred.  The next week, the clasp on the earrings broke, and when I called again, I was told to bring them in.  The jeweler was there and he fixed the earrings.  I was thrilled because I live in South Lake Tahoe and it would have been a week or two if they sent the earrings in for repair and it's not the shortest trip to Reno.  Then last week I noticed one of the opals in in the earrings had a crack.  I called Darrin today and he said just to come in and he would take care of me.  I went to DeVons and he told me he already ordered a new pendant that was on it's way.  When I explained it was the earrings, he said they had another pair of earrings and I could exchange the ones I had for those. He told the woman helping me to just write that the earrings were defective.  I cannot be more satisfied with this store, which is employee owned and definitely goes above and beyond to guarantee customer satisfaction.  Prices are reasonable for a high end jewelry store, the employees are very helpful, and the service is extraordinary.  I cannot praise DeVons Jewelers in Summit Sierra more highly.","date":"2014-10-30 23:21:34"}

I don't have any review to add regarding their food as we left the restaurant right away since we were treated rudely. We came in when they were 75% empty and Open Table was showing plenty of availability to make a reservation (it was a Tue evening). Their staff member asked us 'what do you want', really?? Especially when you're traveling with a baby, you really would like the staff to be more cordial respectful. We wanted to be seated outside to which they said 'no' and when we told them online it's showing that they have plenty of tables available outside suddenly table(s) opened up. Their staff member then barely walked us to our table, told us to leave our stroller 6-7 tables away  and then dumped the high chair for our child next to the table for us to move around. It almost felt they didn't want us there. We got up and left. \n\nMy $.02 to the management of this restaurant - get your staff trained ASAP (and have some racial diversity) to be cordial and respectful before you go out of business!!! \n\nWish I could give them NEGATIVE STARS!!!!","date":"2021-07-14 05:38:55"}

The food was good, but my neighbor's special did not arrive with the other food.  We waited quite a while, and then started to eat our orders.  The waiter came by and said that my neighbor's fish did not look good, so they were redoing the order.  Finally it came and it consisted of a big basket of fries and two little strips of fish.  I guess it was the wine, but I complained (politely) to the waiter about the size of the fish order.  He left and another man came out and said he was the \"owner\" and  asked what was the problem.  I explained, and he said \"what did you expect for $8.00\"?  I told him that the waiter had said a half pound of catfish (possibly we all misunderstood as we are senior citizens and local residents).  At that point he became unglued.  He rudely cursed us out (I never curse) and ordered us out of his restaurant immediately.

She was great at suggesting poses and set ups, and was amazing at scouting out multiple photo shoot locations including checking what the light would be like at certain times of the day, what flowers would be in bloom and how crowded places would most likely be on the day of our photoshoot. We live out of state and couldn't do much of this ourselves so her input and organisation was invaluable. Not only is she skilled but she makes you feel so incredibly comfortable and relaxed. She makes you feel like a good friend from the start. We loved everything about our experience that we returned and had our pregnancy photoshoot done with Lena at Burgundy Blue too.

Not always but fairly often, things seemed to be hurried and disorganized. In many cases the employees, and healthcare workers appear to be discontented. I don't like for anyone to be unhappy and I definitely want the people who are caring for me to enjoy their work. A year ago, I suffered a severe injury and have spent a lot of time searching for good care in Tucson and in other cities. I had never heard of Iora Primary Care before but after a quick phone call I thought I would go and visit them. They have a very unique and effective approach to care that is head and shoulders above the rest. I cannot say enough good things about the clinic and the people at IORA.","date":"2021-08-12 00:15:14"}

But  pizza is one of Italian cuisine and this restaurant needs a improvement as soon as possible because they ruined Italian food and I love this casino but I am dissatisfied and disappointed that this restaurant is not good and they will never offer pizza in fine dining and they should because they have a oven I think that the manger is very mean and doesn't understand that customer would want pizza in fine dining restaurant but not this restaurant they only serve pizza at biscottis but that's not Italian restaurant it's American it's just not good I don't recommend going to this restaurant. Like i said they ruined Italian food and Italian restaurant Entirely. When I will stay at the Peppermill casino resort i will never go to this restaurant ever again because they won't serve pizza I won't eat here at this restaurant ever again because they won't serve pizza at this Italian restaurant I won't go to this restaurant. I hope that the manger or the food and beverage management see this and understand that I won't change my review because they won't add pizza to their fine dining!. And I can't stand that a nice resort like Peppermill won't offer pizza in fine dining that is highly  Ridiculous that they put a Italian restaurant and they don't have a pizza on the menu just because they won't allow it they should because This Italian restaurant has a oven it's not hard to add pizza on the menu. And it's even more  Ridiculous that they only serve it in Biscotti cafe and deli that's is absolutely Horrendous that they won't even do what guest want restaurant to improve and they won't do it even if they have Wood fired oven that is Ridiculous and fish is not a Italian cuisine it's seafood restaurant. And it's really sucks that this hotel resort casino ruined Italian food entirely and they will make more and more guest upset and still they won't listen what guest want and pretty soon a lot of guest will stop coming this restaurant forever because it's ridiculous and horrible that they bring the worst Italian restaurant experience to guest I love pizza and they can easily to Neapolitan Italian pizza it's not hard to do and this restaurant sucks and the management team manger for this restaurant is horribly  rude and won't fix this problem and I will keep this review until they fix this fine dining issue and add pizza. All I want is more people to vote that my review is most helpful I want enough people to vote most helpful so that they will make this happen and fix this problem immediately. Or else I am going to send a email to Anthony Melchiorri to fly down to Reno neveda and put a new season and fix this problem because he is more mean then me and he will definitely make this hotel better and make the menu more guest friendly. Please kind people who do agree with me that this problem needs to be fix ASAP. I hope everyone understand what other guest and me are going through. More people vote the sooner this problem can be resolved. It's just ridiculous that a resort won't offer pizza in fine dining that is a Ridiculous rule they have in the Peppermill casino. And this restaurant disgusted me and the people who is head of team of this restaurant. And people complain this restaurant doesn't open until five that is Ridiculous. And I think I will definitely send a email to Anthony Melchiorri to fix this hotel resort casino ASAP?. Because this hotel really messed up Italian restaurant. It's clear to me that they don't pay the employees very well and the chef so they decided to save money and the only way they had to do this is to not offer pizza in the menu because it would make the pizza expensive on the menu and it would give Much money to the employees and not to the restaurant what heard when you sign  the check it doesn't go to the employees it goes to the restaurant and that is  ridiculous behavior that this hotel have someone needs to have a serious talk with owners and fix this hotel entirely.

The stay was average, however we experienced a big problem after we left. On the day we checked out, it was very early and we were rushing to get to the competition so we packed the room quickly and left. Once we got home that evening, we discovered that we had left our gun in the room. We immediately called and the front desk girl said she just checked someone into that room but she would check to see if it was in there. She came back and said it wasn't there and if the house keeper had found it that it would be locked in her manager's office. She said to call back the next morning when the manager was in. The next morning the manager, the house keeper that originally cleaned the room and the maintenance man searched the room and said they didn't find anything. I filed a police report and the officer went and checked the room and didn't find anything. So, my thought is that a gun just doesn't disappear! I asked the manager to review the security tapes from when we left to when the officer checked the room. She said that there is no way that any of her employees would have stolen the gun. I told her its better to trust but verify the actions your employees are taking. She got very upset that I was asking her to review the videos and then told me that she reviewed the security footage and she didn't find anything. She also mentioned that she wouldn't be able to see the gun from the footage because the housekeeper could have hidden it from the camera. Seems fishy right? I called corporate and they unfortunately don't have the footage in their systems. BEWARE this is very shady business!","date":"2020-10-21 16:36:28"}

It can be pretty slow and I know a lot of it has to do with the fact that they have limited space for making the pizzas so they only make very few at a time, but independent of that fact, I've had some bad servers here in the past who just weren't very attentive and were slow. Also, there have been times when I've called to place an order and even after dialing several times, no one would pick up. But if you're not in a hurry and want to enjoy some darn good pizza, this is definitely the place for you.","date":"2014-05-11 21:51:14"}

It was very long and so I asked the cashier (name begins with a S) if she could call another person. She abruptly said there are no others and said I could go to the coffee shop which wasn't a good solution since I had a cart full of groceries! So I waited and waited and waited.

I never check my car mainly because this has never happened to me before. But as soon as I got home, I parked and immediately saw scratches all over the front right fender and hood of my car. Not only were there scratches, but there was physical grease residue on the bumper. Not soil, wood, bits of curb\/cement, but actual grease that you basically only find in a mechanic shop or when you work on cars. \n\nAlthough the mechanics were amicable, they tried saying it was there and without proof on my end, it was a stale mate. I called the police to file a report, but nothing came of that. The scratches are noticeable but not major. Not enough for me to pay out of pocket to fix, but that's because it's an older car I had planned on running until it died anyway. \n\nAt the end of the day, it was more of a 'principle' sort of situation where I felt shafted that I brought my car in for an oil change, and walked away with damage as well. \n\nThey could have at least offered to cover the cost of my oil change.

Hubby was equally insistent that he wanted a 100 gallon tank.  Why not?  It's not as if propane goes bad if it sits around, and it's no more dangerous to have a 100 gal. tank than a 40 gal. tank.  When the tech couldn't come up with a convincing argument for a smaller tank, he backed off and we got our larger tank.  It took us a while, but we eventually figured out that with a smaller tank, they'd have to be out here, refilling more frequently...for an additional charge.\n\nOn installation day, we made sure that there was plenty of space between the road and the tank so their truck could pull right in and be about 5' from the work area.  The installer parked his truck in front of the *neighbor's* house, (embarrassing!) not even in front of our house, where there was also plenty of space, so every time he had to go retrieve a part or a tool, it took him 3-5 minutes instead of just seconds.  It took us a while to figure this one out, but all we could come up with was that he was being paid for his time, not by the job, and however he could make it take longer was more money in his pocket.\n  \nWe started out our contract with \"auto fill\" (or whatever it's called) meaning that they could come out at will to check the tank and fill, as needed.  Apparently, we needed(?) our first fill-up just after they'd implemented the higher winter rates.  How convenient.  We immediately changed to \"will call\".\n\nHubby requested that a couple of extra shut-off valves be installed in the main line in the basement, for future growth (such as the aforementioned gas stove).  The installer added them, all right, cranking them so unnecessarily tightly that it's going to be a royal pain to loosen them.  Of course, we're supposed to wring our hands and call the company to come out and loosen them for us...for an additional charge.  We may not be as young or strong as we were, but we can be pretty darned stubborn, especially if we feel that there's been an attempt (or several) to take advantage of us, and whatever solution we come up with, it will most certainly NOT include calling them for help...for an additional charge.  \n\nWe are SO not used to professional outfits (not just this one) scheming to squeeze as much money out of a customer as they do here.  Where we're from, where there's actual competition, that company wouldn't last very long, but when there's one company providing a service to an area, customers are stuck without choices.  This outfit has done nothing to cause us to be loyal customers, probably because they don't have to, but if a competitor opens shop in the area, we'll be among the first to switch.\n\nI'm so very tired of the \"only game in town\" mentality that pervades south Jersey.","date":"2018-03-13 20:58:55"}

This place is a mega Asian market for this area and is quite an upgrade from its counterpart on Washington Ave in Philly. Anything Asian related you can probably find here.

We live very close to Old English and quite often order food for delivery. Ever since the virus changed the world we have ordered even more because we want to keep the local businesses open and keep employees with jobs. When we do order it is always for me, my husband, our two children and my in-laws. (So, a lot of people) The food is always good for your typical pizzerias. The orders are always correct and delivery is fast. The delivery drivers are kind and courteous. The reason I gave 3 stars is because there is ONE girl that answers the phones there and is beyond rude! It ruins the experience of a friendly, local restaurant and lately has made us think we should just stop eating here altogether. My husband ordered last night and he said three chicken platters, egg Parmesan and baked ziti...he was stopped and told they didn't have the EL or BZ so my husband turned and asked what they wanted and he told her okay, add another chicken finger platter. She said (very rude) \"So NOW you need four platters?! (And signed really loud) This isn't the first time this girl has acted like this. It's every.....single...time we get her on the phone. We don't know her name. We only know it's NOT Jenny. Jenny is always kind and professional. I just think it's sad that one sour person could potentially make it so people stop going to a restaurant.

Unlike those shoreline tourist trap restaurants, the Oyster Bar is located right downtown in the heart of St. Pete and relies up repeat, mostly resident, not one time hit tourist customers for its survival. Hence, it has to be good.\n\nThe oysters I had were delicious, fat, plump, juicy, devoid of grit or grime, and totally fresh. I couldn't have been more pleased, but the best was yet to come as I had also ordered their lunch special lobster roll and cucumber salad.\n\nTo my shock, when my lobster roll plate arrived it didn't just have one lobster roll but two, both loaded with fine fresh lobster, delicious in flavor,  and in what were actually slightly toasted real New England lobster rolls; no trying to fake it by using hot dog buns as so many other restaurants attempt to do. And as for the cucumber side salad, stunningly delicious. In fact so much so that my dining partner asked and for and was graciously given the ingredients.\n\nThe décor of the Oyster Bar is rustic, but in a way that gives it a splendid ambiance and causal warm feeling.

It is 'fast food' trying to not be fast food.  Were they polite?  Yeah they were ok.  Was the pizza good?  Yeah it was ok.  My friend and I were looking for a place to have some food and cocktails on a Saturday night.  Everything was packed and most places stopped seating.  Covid and all that.  We ended up going to the store and buying a bottle of wine and coming here.  I have never been to a MOD before and didn't know what to expect.  If I had to guess I would say their target customer is in their teens or early twenties (that's who was here that night).  It's a little loud, it's a little bright.  The people that work here are pleasant but as someone else said the ordering system is confusing and I think the young lady working behind the pizza bar just expected us to know what was going on.  The others were gracious, they allowed us to pop open our bottle of Orin Swift and drink while we ate.   Covid restrictions are not their fault, however, the tables were tiny and for the two pies, the bottle of wine and the plates... we just didn't have enough room and I felt cramped.  Again, this is fast food.  Grab your pie and go home.  If you are going to eat in, be prepared it's loud on a Saturday and it's bright so forget about the ambiance.

It is a very nice, new and clean sports bar with lots of flat screen TVs for sports watching! Got all the newest games...I.E- golden tee, silver strike etc... So far so good... The drink prices are standard and the pours are fair to light. We ordered the chicken wings ($15 for 20) which are a bit pricey. We got the med buffalo and the garlic parm. The wings are horrible. It is really hard to mess up chicken wings but this place did just that. Not only were the wings the tiny little no meat size wings they were so over cooked that what little bit of meat on the bones was like jerky! The med buff sauce was fair... The garlic parm sauce was awful! It was basically butter with no seasonings. So very disappointed to say the least! I usually try to give a rest a second chance but based on the fact that they are using the tiny wings it just tells me that they are budget minded and not concerned with quality food. Sorry but with its location and this quality food this Nortons location will not survive long. They have to be losing money already! Good TV's for a sports bar but that is it! Def not enough to get my business again!","date":"2013-03-01 16:19:13"}

Here is a summary of what has happened in the last three weeks:\n\n1.  Ordered a new sectional from Bob's Discount Furniture in Indianapolis, IN.  The experience was good and handled well.  The sectional was $3,000.00; so we didn't get the cheapest thing in the store!\n2. Delivery of new sectional was also great.\n3. Sectional was only two weeks old and the recliner came up and wouldn't go back down. \n4. Called to get that piece of the sectional replaced (stayed on hold 20 minutes) and they refused to replace the broken piece but sent out a technician to \"fix\" it.\n5. Technician came out and couldn't fix the broken piece but would get parts to come back and fix it.\n6. We called again two days later and the technician never ordered the parts, so after waiting on hold for 30 more minutes the man who answered the phone said he would order the parts and ship them to my house.  He then told me to call back when the parts come in so they can order another technician to come fix it.  I asked if they could just replace that section of the sectional and he was extremely rude.  He said no and hung up on me.\nSo, now I'm stuck for at least two more weeks with a section of my sectional stuck in the reclined position for at least a month.  The customer service is the WORST I have ever experienced and I'm kicking myself in the butt for thinking it was a good idea to buy a nice piece of furniture from Bob's.  Learned my lesson and hopefully you won't buy your next piece of furniture from them either.","date":"2017-09-01 16:05:38"}

I have used them for over 10 years and within a few months  this animal hospital has completely gone downhill. They don't answer their phone, they tell you they can't see you for a week, and they overbook so bad that when you're there you wait hours to have your dog seen. Due to this overbooking greed they do not have the staff to actually take care of your baby. My dog died ALONE in a CAGE last Saturday because they didn't even have the decency to call me and tell me he was going down. The night before, the doctor's exact words were \"he's out of the woods\". I had him on  24 hour care for several days and I was there the day before hand feeding him. The Dr. called me and actually said  \"Maxi's not doing so well\" I immediately said I'll be right there and then the doctor says he died two minutes ago. How can you \"not be doing well\" if you are already dead? I am besides myself!!! She told me they tried to feed him 15 minutes before they called me but that he didn't seem right. I can walk to the clinic. I live minutes away. They should've called me and not let my dog die alone in a cage!!!!!!!!!!!! I can no longer recommend this place and will never bring a pet there EVER again! Dr. Camp came to my house a few years ago to  help my 15 year old Labradoodle go over the bridge. Every time I try to book an appointment with him they tell me he is only there on Thursdays to do surgery. They lied to me the day before my last appointment and said he would not be there but I saw him when I was in the back trying to hand feed my little Maxie. Just thought I would mention that.

Some people really dig it, but I find that it's often dry and the crust and filling are not proportional... This is absolutely not the case of the pies at Grand Traverse Pie Company. They are delicious and moist and perfect. I especially love their apple crumb pie... which is weird because of all the pies I don't like, apple is usually the pie I don't like the most. (Does that make sense? lol.)\n\nAnyway. I would also like to respectfully disagree with my fellow reviewer... I've had the opportunity to enjoy a few of their food offerings. Their loaded potatoes are amazing (and HUGE), but my favorite thing there (in terms of non-dessert) is definitely their chicken pot pie! The crust and filling are both superior to many pot pies I've enjoyed in the past. The crust is flaky and light, and the filling has a good chicken to vegetable ratio. They also make a pretty decent chicken salad sandwich!\n\nThe place has a cozy, contemporary feel. It would be a great place to study with friends while enjoying pie... (if only they stayed open a little later.) It's always been pretty quiet when we've been there, but, again we don't always eat at conventional times.\n\nThe other thing that has struck me every time we've been there is how GENUINELY nice the staff is. They are always pleasant and helpful. It has a bit of a family owned feel, in that sense... And even though I know it's a chain, it feels like everyone there has a vested interest in making your experience great.\n\nGrand Traverse Pie Company is definitely comfort food at its best.

But how they run the cafeteria here boggles my mind. It is stuffed full of sugary and salty processed foods. It is very reasonably priced which is nice, but it's unbelievable how unhealthy the vast majority of the food is. They have slivers of attempts at healthy food, but it's side show compared to the sea of junk food. \n\nIt would be unreasonable (to me) to think diet can fix any health problem. But it would also unreasonable to me to think that food has no impact on health - yet that is the impression I received visiting their cafeteria.

I sent an email blast to my group of travel buddies and we booked two days later. This is our second trip with Gate 1 and we will definitely be using them again in the near future for our travel desires! \n\nDawn Stott in the sales office is a fantastic resource of information and her patience is incredible. Our group of 4 did a conference call to her to book the trip and between getting disconnected and having one person's credit card declined, she spent a solid 45 minutes with us to ensure that everything was correct. \nWe booked our optionals soon after and sent in our check payments to get the reduced price. The paperwork with all the logistics arrived when promised and we were able to make arrangements with our work\/vacation schedules. All the logistics for the trip were flawless between the flights to\/from the US, the transportation between airport and hotel, transportation during our time in Dubai and the schedule ran smoothly. Our tour manager was Hench and while he was rather new to being a tour guide, he did well with accommodating to our group of 36. \n\nThe hotel in Dubai was the Hyatt Place and it was perfect. It was a good location for us because during our free time we went to shop and check out some local restaurants. The rooms were spacious, clean and comfortable. Jane at the front desk was great at answering our questions and always had a smile on her face when we walked through the front door. The breakfast had slight variations every morning but included fresh fruit, cereals and yogurts, hot items such as eggs and chicken sausage, toast and pastries, fruit juices, and lunchmeats and cheeses. We had the dinner buffet one evening and it was fantastic.\n\nThe itinerary for Dubai and Abu Dhabi was full of activities yet we had a decent amount of free time to explore on our own, I felt it was a good combination. We only took a little bit of spending money and brought home a bunch of dirham because the prices were cheap for everything. Lunch on your own runs about $3 and dinner around $8-10. Shopping in the souks allows you to barter for lower prices so we did well on our spices.\n\nMany of my friends and family members couldn't believe that we were going to Dubai because they believed it to be unsafe, but honestly I felt more safe there than at home in the US! There is little to no crime since 90% of the people are ex-pats working in the UAE on a visa. Any violations or crime record would have them deported back to their home country immediately. We walked around in the evenings and explored as much of the city as we could but never felt unsafe.\nGate 1 is a fantastic travel company who offer good deals so you can see the world on any budget. I highly recommend them because their logistics are flawless and their staff is fantastic to work with during your planning process. Thank you!","date":"2015-04-03 13:35:44"}

I scoured the other reviews prior to going which is why we were in no rush to go. We finally did. Here are the results:\n\nGroup of 6 dining at 7:00 on a Wednesday night. \n\nAtmosphere: this place is much larger inside than I realized! Lots of tvs above the bar...some playing sports and some playing (current and oldies but goodies) music videos. It is pretty loud inside. We had a hard time hearing each other at times but we didn't have to yell. We were sitting nowhere near the bar. There is a good mix of tables; high tops, booths, round tables, etc. The bar was packed. It is very long and there is only one side for patrons to sit. There is a really awesome outdoor area perfect for relaxing with friends or a date. \n\nService: we had a reservation but had to wait a little bit past our time. Nothing major. The hostess had a bit of an attitude. Our server was a bit awkward. He was not very attentive. We asked for water but didn't receive any. I had to ask again. He was a bit awkward with small talk when we tried. He didn't come to ask how our food was until some people were already finished so if there was a problem it would have been too late. It wasn't terrible service but it wasn't great, either. \n\nThe bathrooms were ATROCIOUS! This is always concerning to me because I feel like if the bathrooms are that nasty, how clean is your kitchen? It smelled like a subway station upon entering. The scent of urine hit me like a train. There was trash literally thrown in the sink. Gum wrappers, a napkin, paper. Really? \n\nFood: Pretty good! \nCrab dip- mostly cream and cheese, not much crab\nBuffalo shrimp- a bit over cooked but the taste was good. Nowhere near as delicious as Redstone's buffalo shrimp. The blue cheese was good \nHouse salad - large, good\nFish tacos- a little dry, the bottoms broke open from being soggy. I think they were sitting for a bit while waiting for everyone else's food to be ready. The flavor was good. Fried mahi, not grilled. There was an extremely flavorful corn and bean salsa of sorts served on the side which I wasn't expecting. This was excellent!\nSriracha and City Works burgers - good, not great \nFries- hot and tasty, respectable portion. Not the 3 or 4 fries other people are talking about. \nFilet Sliders - only 2, gentlemen would prefer 3, as it was a small portion for them\n\nDrinks- worst Riesling I've ever had in my life. Gave me a headache and I haven't had a wine headache in a very long time. It was very dry. It almost tasted like beer. Never again!\nBeer - just ok. Different sizes available. Chalkboard with beers listed on wall\nStrawberry mixed drink - delicious\nDessert - only two options which is kind of weak. We did not try either\n\nOverall, it was a good experience. We will return and would recommend it to other people. Definitely make a reservation!

We also got 4 slices of bread each individually wrapped, which I thought was cool. It was busy, but not too busy. I was worried about it with the race stuff going on down the street. I was happy to be able to introduce my husband into some finger licking good ribs!","date":"2015-05-17 02:33:07"}

Located on Centennial Blvd, near White Bison. 51st Deli, Frothy Monkey, and several other notable establishments, Frutta Bowls has a homey vibe to it. There are couches and tables if you choose to eat in - unfortunately I was unable to stay this morning, but I definitely will be back. They have menus up on the wall, as well as smaller hand-held options. I always like to ask the owners\/folks who work in the establishment what their favorite is vs what is popular. The gentleman who took my order said that hands down, the Frutella bowl, followed by the Fiji bowl, were amongst the most popular sellers. I had been eyeing a bowl called the Coco Puff, but his avid endorsement of the Frutella bowl really got me, so I went with it. Best decision! \n\nSo. Let me break down the bowls. They have 3 different bases you can use, from what I saw. I had acai (such a fun word). There is also pitaya, and you could have done oatmeal as well, for a more a breakfast-y feel. I had the acai base, topped with granola, topped with swirls of peanut butter AND Nutella, topped with fresh banana and strawberry slices, topped with coconut flakes. I meant to take a picture,  but I'm gonna be honest folks, I took one bite, and a few minutes later, was looking down at an empty bowl. Lol! The bowls are a decent size - you will be full after eating one. Compare the bowl sizes to those Publix fruit bowls, and you know what you're working with.\n\nI plan on going back... maybe as soon as this evening. The bowls range in price from about $7-$10.

I found the bed to be quite comfortable as well. The one exception to all the positives was that we had an A\/C unit in the room instead of central cooling in the house, which is fine if different guests want different temperatures in their rooms, but the A\/C unit was very old and loud. It cooled perfectly well, but was better left on while we were gone during the day so that the room would be cool when we got back, so that we could keep it turned off while we were there. Otherwise, having the A\/C on in the room made watching TV or relaxing there just a bit less pleasant due to the loudness of the A\/C unit. If the room had a quiet A\/C unit then the interior would get 10\/10.\n\n\nExtended continental breakfast: 8\/10:\n\nThe hours for this were reasonable, making it easy to grab food even if you slept in kind of late. The selection of items was generous, and when we were there, they had hard-boiled eggs available in addition to the juice, fruit and grains that you expect. The cereals and bagels were mediocre quality but I felt like overall I was getting a good deal to get all of the breakfast food included with the room price.\n\n\nService: 9\/10:\n\nEd was very accommodating and pleasant.

I did request a toilet plunger be brought to the bathroom before leaving for the morning, but by the time that I returned after a couple of hours the plunger was not there, because I think it wasn't brought until the afternoon when the maid service went there. Otherwise I can't think of anything that wasn't perfect about the service.\n\n\nLocation: 10\/10:\n\nBeing able to walk to everything in the French Quarter made our trip much more enjoyable, and we were still secluded from the noise by being tucked away on Chartres St. I wouldn't have changed anything about where we stayed in the city. Parking the car on the street was also no problem.\n\n\nValue: 10\/10:\n\nI am convinced that by staying here I probably got the best deal in New Orleans to be had within this price range. \n\n\nOVERALL: 9\/10\n\nMy girlfriend liked the place as much as I did. I researched as thoroughly as I could to plan this trip and was concerned by some of the negative reviews but felt more at ease after seeing that they were several years old and mostly upset with the service back when somebody other than Ed was running the place. I also saw a review which complained that the room was in bad condition, but our room was in very good condition and everything was kept very clean, so the few negative reviews I've seen did not at all match our experience as of June 2013. I enjoyed Lions Inn as a place to come home to at the end of the day, not just as a place to sleep and wake up. We also were glad to have the pool and the generous breakfast options, which were more than adequate. Based on our experience I would return here if I vacationed in New Orleans again.","date":"2013-06-19 18:22:47"}

The habanero wings had really good flavor but were a bit too smokey for my taste.  This location was decent and spacious, the seats were metal chairs (cringy) but the food made up for it.  Only downside is that they have pepsi products to drink if you're a coke person. Will be back for sure.","date":"2020-10-16 01:21:30"}

I swear they must put drugs in their sushi because 3 hours after stuffing my face with sushi from here I wanted more. Haha.\n\nAnyway. It's not too far from the freeway, I mean it really is tucked away quietly in a nicer neighborhood of Reno. Small parking lot, small restaurant, but totally worth a long wait. DO NOT HESITATE if the wait is long. Your time, money, taste buds is worth it all. \n\nWe have gone twice in the last 3 weeks already. We really enjoy having Beto do our sushi, hes very sociable and we got to know him well in the two visits. And he remembered us the second time we came. It might be because I'm Asian and my husbands Mexican, so we are a odd couple with our little 10 month old. ANYWAY.\n\nVery personable sushi staff, particularly Beto.\n\nDining area seating is fast service, the waitresses are really on top of drinks, clearing plates and asking if the table is doing good.\n\nSushi rice and fish Ratio is perfect, not too much and just enough to balance out the fish. \n\nSnow Mountain - YUMMERS! my husband is a huge fan of this!\nSpicy Tuna - GREAT!!!!\nSpicy Habanero Tuna - EVEN BETTER, I love this one, so good!\nBlack Sunshine - AWESOME!\nHiroba - Okay\nGodzilla - Great!\nRainbow - Really good.\nUnagi - Good-okay, just a reg unagi\nLulu - This was okay, it was a little too much, for me\nSeared Maguro - DELICIOUS!\nSalmon Nigiri - MOUTH WATERING, MELT IN YOUR MOUTH GREATNESS\nMickey Mouse - SO GOOOOOOD!\nUpside Down Shrimp - REally TASTY and yummy\nMussels - Really tasty, not the best I have had but really good.\nEdamame - Really good, steamed hot and sprinkled with salt\nGolden Gate - Really yummy and tastes refreshing\nKwon-a good roll, its simple, lightly spicy, my sister in law and husband like it a lot\nSpecial godzilla - better than the regular godzilla\nfried jalapeno with crab salad on top - pretty good, I dont like fried much but its good\n\n\nI will add more once I remember what I tried, we have tried so much and they are sooo good.\n\n\nAnyways I don't even know how to explain it.

Some of my friends thought they were excellent, others bemoaned the long wait and service.  \n\nPros:\n-very good rice.  Superior in fact to any other sushi I've had in reno.  It's all about the texture here.  no smushed up rice, nice individual grains that hold together well and are seasoned lightly with slightly sweet vinegar.  \n-best tobiko I've had in Reno.  I generally ask for tobiko to be omitted from all my sushi orders in Reno because of one too many experiences with old mushy fishy tobiko.  Theirs is visibly different.  bright almost sparkling (no cloudy tobiko here) eggs that have that proper tight burst of slightly smoky sweet brine.  absolutely delicious.  \n-a few unique rolls and ingredients that aren't available anywhere else (yet). Crispy Shallots? yummmm. Monkfish liver? not my thing, but appreciated by others I'm sure.\n-chef was fast and friendly.  willing to modify rolls without hesitation (a lot of their rolls aren't available as handrolls according to the menu, our chef gladly made perfect handrolls for us).  Al answered all my questions (I had a lot!) with a smile and gave honest recommendations.\n-good variety of appetizers included in the AYCE price.  the appetizers we had were small portions, which is perfect to get a taste but not get full on them.\n-hot sake included in Dinner.  The sake they serve is very rich and sweet, paired deliciously with the sushi.\n\n\nCons:\n-limited menu for AYCE.  We actually did not run out of selections to try, but we aren't super heavy eaters either.  Between 2 of us we shared 5 rolls.  I have friends who can eat 7-10 rolls alone, and I can see them being bored by the choices.  \n-location of the restaurant.  It's basically a fake patio\/al fresco area outside of Roxy.  It's a walkway between Eldorado and Silver Legacy by the fountain.  Between the fountain, occasional live music from Roxy, and the constant pedestrian traffic, it's very loud and you get gawked at.  \n-$1 extra to have rolls topped with mixed crab.  It's just the fake crab surimi stuff so I don't get why the extra charge. \n\nOverall right now it stands as my favorite sushi joint in Reno despite it's limitations.  I don't mind the short menu for AYCE (I will most likely just go a la carte in the future anyway) and the chefs seem more than willing to concoct an off menu item based on your preferences.\n\none warning.  listen to the chef when he advises your lower your spice rating on any roll that includes habanero.  yeeeeaaoooouch.  Those are the hottest peppers I've had in so long.  They use orange habaneros, and even a spice rating of 3 (out of 10) had us panting and sweating.  This is for a girl that usually insists on extra extra hot.","date":"2011-09-07 03:12:16"}

Waste of my time and fuel, getting a babysitter for my three kids all to get to Reno dodge and be sent home cause they ordered the wrong part. Now here we are a few months later. I took my car in Thursday morning at 9am. Got a call later in the day it's e done Friday morning. Friday morning comes, I'm getting the kids all squared away so I can head down to dodge, when I get a phone call from them. My car now will not be ready saturday.

Service isn't usually super personable but has been friendly, somewhat helpful and attentive. Food has always been great and plentiful. \n\nLast visit I had the shrimp and potato enchiladas which were delicious! Lots of sauteed veggies and large shrimp, with a mashed potato filling. My friend and I split the queso fundido con chorizo as an appetizer, which was the weirdest plate ever. A sizzling plate of chorizo that was almost crunchy in several places, with just a few crumbles of cheese on top. It was kind of tasty, but not what we were expecting as an appetizer. Another friend got one of their combo platters which looked fairly standard, but large and delicious. Another got lobster enchiladas. For under ten bucks, we all expected fake lobster maybe, or maybe just a little bit of meat. Nope, all three enchiladas were stuffed to the brim with real lobster! Based on our three meals, I would suggest branching out more to their house specialties since they are all super cheap and really delicious! I also love their always-fluffy rice that is tasty but a good side to not overpower the rest of your plate. Last but not least, we all ordered grande margaritas with our meals.. Seriously bigger than my head, and super smooth going down! I would go every week if I could.\n\nThe restaurant is also pretty good for ambiance. the place is huge and I can't imagine there ever being a wait for a table. The bar area is nice as well, and has sweet karaoke on Thursday nights. \n\n**Edited!

Dessert was beautifully presented and featured unusual ingredients that you don't see in many restaurants in Santa Barbara.  I had the cherimoya semifreddo and my partner had the cassava creme brulee with purple potato ice cream.  \n\nThe glaring problem was the disorganization in the restaurant.  We were seated for 15 min without anyone coming to take our orders.  We sat right across from the hostess, but she was busy looking at her phone.  The water boy came twice to refill our water glasses and we finally asked him on the whereabouts of our server.  When he finally came around, he was apologetic, and gave us 2 complementary drink.  The dinner proceeded smoothly from that point until dessert, which again took a long wait.  Finally, there was a mix up with the credit card.

So I kind of knew what I was going to be getting. A great meal but I was never totally blown away here.  After last night, it would be impossible for me to rate this any lower than 10 stars.  But since yelp will only let me do five, that will have to suffice.\n\nSince we went here for New Years, they had only a five course dinner available for $63 a person.  At first glance $63 does sound like a lot of money but a) for New Years, not really and b) the amount of food you get for $63 turned out to be a steal.  My table had five people (including another yelper) and I thought about critiquing each dish, but that would get too lengthy.  However, I cannot do this review without mentioning a few things:\n\nThe waitress, Jen, greeted us with a complementary glass of champagne.  Each person at the table got their own chef created amuse-bouche.  The fried feta dumpling with tomato sauce was particularly delicious.  It was like a traditional \"mozzarella stick\" you often find, however feta of course, and very creamy.  The fresh tomatoes were great compared to a sauce.\n\nNext came the appetizers.  Now, this ranks up with *one of* the best things I ever ate.  Which is saying a lot.  For my appetizer I got the Thai Curry Steak Eggrolls filled with shitake mushrooms, peppers and cream cheese, with hot mustard sauce.  Think *fried Philly cheese steak*.  The mustard was amazing, and what I would imagine the high a cocaine addict must feel considering the spicy mustard seemed to zing from my mouth to my nose to my brain rendering me completely addicted.\n\nI was very impressed with my experience here, more so than any other time I had been here.  Maybe it was because it was New Years and the chef's were on top of their game... maybe it was because I was able to sample so many things.  I would not be surprised to see the young executive chef Andrew Loeffler going on and doing even greater things in the future.\n\nI'd give just about anything for more of those Thai Curry Steak Eggrolls.","date":"2011-01-01 17:25:53"}

The FOS was noteworthy as it was not overwhelmingly salty (as tends to happen with FOS). The escargot, however, could've used an extra sprinkle of salt and a crusty slice of baguette to sop up the herby butter. \n\nMy boyfriend got the steak frites with mushroom sauce, which was absolutely delicious and so simple but, again, a little under salted.

We had 3 different Bread and Butter dishes with a few different types of pickles.  I had one spicy pickle that caught me off guard I like hot foods so I had not been warned just to get a reaction.  After the initial shock at how hot it was wore off it was good just not what I was expecting from a pickle.  We also had a carrot \/ radish raw dish I ordered a steak and cheese sandwich and my friend had a mushroom sandwich.  Overall it was just not what I expected, but really enjoyed everything.  Now for the beer again I usually have 3 or 4 a year and try to be home and in bed around 10 to 1030.  Well I had not seen my friends in about 8 or 9 years so time got away from us all.\nAfter eating talking and drinking I had had 5 beers while chatting and when I checked my watch thinking it was about 11 I found out it was now 1AM.

It's so cozy to sit at a coffee shop with a warm mug in your hands on a cold winter's day. Not so much with a hot paper cup.\n\nThey do have one of my favorite teas, Numi's Berry Black is quite hard to find usually. It is the main reason I keep going back there.\n\nTheir muffins are really good, but I have to refer to my husband's opinion on their bagels.\n\nHis words: \"Why would you serve a sliced bagel open sides up in two halves? A bagel has its toppings only on the top. You're essentially getting half the bagel that you ordered, and half of a plain one. It should be served closed, then sliced in half vertically.\"\n\nBottom line: We'll continue to go there from time to time, but it's not getting 5 stars.","date":"2012-01-17 04:43:57"}

Today was such a beautiful day that I decided to sit outside and soak up the sun and enjoy my late lunch.  Service was great as always with the food coming out in a decent amount of time. I don't mind the wait because your food will come out so piping hot that you can't eat it right away. I had the 2 piece dark chicken only. Well it came with bread also and I ordered a side of okra. The food is good here but a bit pricy in my opinion w basic slaw and beans on the platter. I prefer to just order my chicken and add a side. Next time around I will try a dessert.","date":"2017-06-06 21:55:42"}

The place down the street had a problem seating all 8 of us, but this place could seat our group, so an extra star for that. \nI was pretty wasted, so I don't remember what burger I got but it was damn fine.  I am leaning towards the Kuma original burger (or whatever it's called), because I probably asked our waiter for a recommendation, as I normally do, and that one seems pretty popular.\nI remember the waiter recommending the Mac and cheese, so I got a giant tub of that, and it was fuckin' good.  Even finished it off when we got home on Sunday.  Delicious.\nNow to the Metal.  Metal and I have had a very tumultuous relationship down through the years.  In my younger days it was Maiden and Judas Priest, but new metal is lost on me, and don't even get me started on Death or Black Metal.  I have seen High on Fire, Mastodon, GoatWhore, among others, and just not a fan.  20 minutes after we showed up, it went to all ZZ Top, so more stars and a big tip for the wait staff for facilitating the crunchy, drunk Fuckers from out of town.  \nHighly recommend.","date":"2021-09-28 22:26:24"}

We had a pleasant conversation between 2 vets then on to business of windows. He went in to details about the windows and all the functions, counted windows in house to do and gave a price about 1200 per window installed. Of coarse we are getting our 5% SAM discount.He ask what our credit score were for which i knew. hes said that he needed to run a soft credit check to see if we qualify to do business for which I repeated that we don't want to run a credit check because how it affects scores and i'm waiting on 2 inquires to expire. He assured me that we were not applying for a loan and I told him I deal with cash, no credit. ok. We negotiated for 8 window to be done and set the appointment for final measurement for Feb 6 2018.\n\nToday I get home, have dinner, go to office in home to see e-mails and mails. Opening one of the mail from a loan company saying that I have been approved for a home repair loan and I went ballistic. Finding the number to the loan company I called them to find out how this was possible. I nor wife applied for a home improvement loan especially from Atlanta GA. See we live in TX. So I inquired and my wife and found out that POWER submitted the application from signatures written on electronic tablet. Don't sign anything on those electronic tablets. I really was looking forward to having those windows but after going through the packet and reading everything Marcus printed and seeing for first time what I he didn't show me when I was signing.\n\nThe verbal agreement between Marcus and the wife & I was,\n1. I didn't have to pay until I was satisfied with the windows and  \n    installation up until 30 days after.\n2. The windows installation would not be until end of June.\n3. There would not be any financing involved.\n4. Get approval from HOA before commencing project. Strict HOA.\n5. No more than 2 day removal and install.\n6. Satisfactory sweep and clean up after install.\n\nMarcus And I spoke many times over about credit, cost , payment and he assured us that there wasn't going to be financing, just soft credit to see if we were over 650 because that's the company's approval requirement. Yes they would take care of HOA and that it takes 6-8 week to build and ship by end of June once your order gets in line, and Who is at HOA to contact for approval. See living in Houston there's a problem of contractor's asking fro half the money up front then never showing up to complete. That's why the assured that no money exchanges unless i'm satisfied.\n Sorry to see so many unhappy customers out there.","date":"2018-01-30 06:29:49"}

Very busy Friday night, we started with a build your own beer flight. The server was very helpful in explaining how to choose our beers and told us about the interesting offerings based off the kinds of beers we said we liked. We ended up getting some odd choices like peanut butter, Hersheys and a smores. Interesting but no way could I have had more than what we got in this flight. Lol. We had our eye on a few mised drinks but were completely full after getting burgers. I got the Bolts burger with loaded tots. Man, I usually don't go for burgers but it seemed like this place would do them right. They absolutely had an 8nsane one with the Bolts burger named after their beloved local hockey champs. A huge burger with a \"puck\" of Mac and cheese and bacon. I added tomato and onion. Very filling (I had to omit most of the bun but mostly because those loaded tots were so darn good. That beer cheese was delicious. I was very happy with my choice and happy to make it back to my room and change into my jammies. Lots of servers looking happy to be at work and we even spotted a few eating themselves. Lots of customers and the place was really jamming on a Friday night.

Car is listed at a price, but it's actually about 3-4 grand more then that after all their ridiculous fees and such. If you have a trade in that you owe money on, you don't get the tax incentive if you buy a new car from them, which i've never heard of before. They have a ridiculous \"reconditioning\" fee for like 1.5k, shouldn't that be included in the price of the car not when you sit down? Also they have a high dealer fee and a low jack fee. A bunch of fees that make a car 3-5k more then what is advertised online. Sat down to get the numbers and they were insanely high and ridiculous, plus seeing all the fees. 30k car turns into a 35k car...

During peak times this place can be very busy, with the line going outside.  There is a reason for this though, as the ice cream is very good.  I really like the old school theme Franklin Fountain portrays.  Whenever I enter I feel I went back in time.  They even have an old phone where you dial the numbers to call!  \n\nAs for the ice cream flavors, my favorites from what I have tried include Hydrox Cookie (Cookies and Cream), Franklin Mint Chip, Pistachio (no it is not green!), and Maple Walnut.  I do have to say they make their Pistachio well here, and I liked the Maple Walnut in the fact that the flavors did not overwhelm each other.  You can also get sundaes, shakes, egg cream, sodas, etc. here.  \n\nI'll mention though that the prices here are a little higher than you would typically see at a another ice cream shop, so be mindful of that especially since this place is CASH ONLY.  However, the ice cream is good enough for me not to mind paying these prices.  A nice touch here is that their to-go containers are the same as the ones you get at Chinese restaurants... interesting!  \n\nI always distinctly remember the staff being very friendly to me whenever I am here, even during their busiest days.","date":"2015-03-24 21:18:44"}

After 13 months of payments, I decided to seek alternate means of exercise since I was only using the treadmill there anyway. My husband wanted to continue so I asked the \"manager\" for our options. He said they would impose a $150 cx fee and my husbands rate would be $46\/mo.

In fact, it is cheaper to stay on the contract.\n\nNow here's where they are foolish. My husband is so irritated that he is not going to renew in 11 months. So, by enforcing this cancellation fee thereby compelling me to stay on, they are not just losing my membership and goodwill but they are getting a bad review, AND losing my husband's renewal at $46\/mo down the road; never mind the cost of acquiring new business which they probably don't even understand.

The 1st time was for brunch with my boyfriend a few months after opening. Bulla is a solid 4 Stars. I'll admit after my 1st experience I would have left 5 stars but  this review is an average of all my visits. Small plates\/ tapas style  restaurants are my favorite because I love being able to eat multiple dishes instead of settling for one large dish. This is a great all round restaurant ideal for  all celebrations like birthdays, happy hour, anniversaries, date night, girls night brunch group dates. The decor is modern and I love the varied seating between tables and chairs, partial booths and high top booths as well as high top chairs. There is a pretty decent size bar area. Definitely always make a reservation for Friday's and Saturday's  around dinner time. \n\nBRUNCH: \nWhy Bulla is one of my favorite brunch spot and where it takes the cake for me is it's pre-fixxe brunch menu  for 27 dollars and bottomless mimosas\/ sangrias (18 dollars) . Most places offer bloodmary and mimosas and since I'm not a fan of blood Mary's, I fell in love with Bulla for bottomless sangria to change it up. What's great is that you don't have to stick to just sangria or mimosas, mix and switch as you choose. The pre-fixe menu is pretty legit because you get full sized portions and get to pick an item from 3 categories , appetizer, entree, dessert\/ sweet. Both times I have done the pre-fixe menu and shared my items with another person and we were both incredible overstuffed and couldn't finish everything. So it's a lot of food for two people and definitely way too much for one person to finish, but you can always take your items boxed to go . My first visit we  ended up taking the blueberry ricotta pancakes straight to go. I'd suggest not picking something very rich each time if you plan on  finishing everything. \n\nFor brunch I've had the had the \"Coca\" aka flatbread- Mahón cheese, quail eggs, bacon, caramelized onions, mushrooms. Loved it, especially when the eggs were slightly runny. Good change up for a breakfast pizza with quail eggs. The caramelized onions and mushrooms created so much flavor and I savored that flatbread each bite.  Next I had the \"Huevos bulla\" - eggs, homemade potato chips, Serrano, potato foam, truffle oil. Very delicious but after just eating the breakfast flatbread it was too rich for me to eat a lot.  Next I had the ricotta blueberry pancakes and they weren't the best pancakes I've had but good. My 2nd visit for brunch I got the chicken and waffles as my 2nd course. I did not like it. Would have been much much better if the whole dish  wasn't  drenched  in the  chorizo gravy. Better yet just not have it at all. I recently checked the menu and so glad they removed the chorizo gravy form this dish, because it made it toooo tooo rich to eat and made everything soggy.  So maybe worth a try now. I like my waffle crisp and not a soft baked texture. When I had this dish the waffle was a soft texture.\n\nFOOD:\nSome solid things to order are the Patatas bravos- crispy potatoe cubes with a sirachaesque aioli sauce. I enjoy these when they're extra crispy. The gambas al ajillo (10 dollars). Small but the brandy- garlic-olive oil mixture is to die for. I wish the shrimp was charred and not simmered though for more flavor but still good because of that olive oil mixture it sits in mixture. My other favorite thing to order is the  pork pinxtos (9 dollars)- Cumin marinated pork loin skewers, mojo verde, Greek yogurt. Pork is so flavorful and multiple friends have said they thought the yogurt sauce would be weird for them but loved it!  I've had the \"tabla mixta\"- Tetilla cheese, manchengo cheese, Serrano ham, chorizo, olives (happy hour $18). The first time I ordered the charcuterie here I didn't like  the crackers that came with it, so I was so happy when I saw this time around it came with little grilled baguette pieces instead. \n\nWas not a fan of the queso fundido but other friends liked it but commented it was much  more tomatoey than cheesey, and would have preferred more melted cheese. I  hated the tomatoe sauce. The chorizo pieces was not crumbled but cubed and honestly it brought me back to when I was younger and I tried a frozen pizza bagel bite.  I like my queso fundido cheesy and with crumbled chorizo. The meatballs are ok, moist but not enough season\/ flavor for me.\n\nHAPPY HOUR: \nAll drinks area half  off from 4-7 Monday to Sunday.  There is a select HH food menu but only available at the bar. Usually most places  HH are weekdays but I love that Bulla also offers HH weekends too! I've come with a group to HH here a few times. Around 5 on Fridays bar is usually already filled or almost filled. Drinks are always well made. I love the Moscow  mules here. I'm not a bourbon drinker at all and I really liked the\" bullfighter\" because it's pretty balanced. You taste the bourbon just  enough.","date":"2019-04-14 20:51:55"}

It was a large portion and I definitely had more than enough to take home.

I overheard one of the waitresses talking to another customer and it seemed as though it was very recently that most of the (main) staff had come to the States. It is truly admirable to start a business in a foreign country, so I give them major props. However, that meant that certain staff members were limited when speaking English. When I flagged down a staff to ask about something, he redirected me to another staff member stating he did not speak English. After, I realized that the more fluent staff members were the ones taking the orders and overall speaking with the customers.

It took me literally 35 minutes to do my simple order. It also randomly re-added things into my \"cart\" that I had deleted out of there. The customer service was awful. The cashier checked out my purchases about as fast as the computer functioned, and came to a dead halt in the middle of my checkout to have a detailed conversation with a customer who had just walked in about her return. I asked 2 different workers to speak to the manager and express my concerns about the computer. The first one did nothing to put me in touch with the manager, and the 2nd one only did so after another long wait. All the manager had to say was \"Yeah, it's slow.\" All told, I was in the store an hour and a half, after a long day at work, just to get some napkins, plates, and forks.

The hardest part of all this was dealing with Home Depot's warranty department they were extremely difficult. We had no issues with VTC, only purchasing the LG refrigerator and dealing with Warranty from Home Depot! I would not hesitate to recommend Video Tech Center.","date":"2020-11-05 14:24:05"}

It's a restaurant that focuses on a specific menu item, but has a huge draw to locals and tourists alike. There is always a line here, at least when I've visited, so plan accordingly unless you line up at the door prior to opening. Part of the reason for the long wait is because Biscuit Love is a fast casual restaurant, but don't stress as there is no table service. You order everything prior to taking a seat. As people leave, they let more people in. With that, the line moves at a respectable pace.\n\nAs with the name, Biscuit Love's specialty are their biscuits. These are buttermilk biscuits, the layered kind, baked to perfection. I especially like these kind of biscuits (not to say rolled, drop, or other types aren't as good) because of the way I eat them\/pair them. You see, layered biscuits are especially good with gravy. I peel off a layer or two, set it on my plate, and then scoop a spoonful of gravy on it. Not only do I efficiently and expertly have the perfect flaky biscuit layer to gravy ratio, it ensures nothing is left after the first bite. Of course, this method works great with jams, jellies, etc.\n\nThe menu here is simple but it is a bit pricey, even for a breakfast\/brunch restaurant. I dropped $33 for my meal alone. Most of them feature their signature biscuits (including sweet appetizers) but there is a small menu for those who would rather not have a biscuit with your breakfast\/brunch. Their main entrees are all big enough for one person and can satiate even people with bigger appetites. I was tempted to order 2 entrees but I settled on the \"Princess\" entree, a side of sausage gravy, and The Bloody (a bloody mary).\n\nThe Princess is a Nashville-style spicy boneless chicken thigh, topped with pickles, mustard, and honey on top of a buttermilk biscuit. What they don't tell you (unless you've been here before) is with the Princess, there's another biscuit on your plate separate from what the fried chicken sits on. So technically you get 2 biscuits. What does one do with an extra biscuit? Add sausage gravy of course. Ordering a biscuit & sausage gravy entree cost $9.50 by itself, so I saved $5.50 by doing it my way. Of course, all my money went out the window when I ordered The Bloody, which was good but not worth the $10 price tag.\n\nSo how was it? The Princess was crunchy, juicy, tender, with a nice blend of spiciness, sweet, and bitter\/sour all mixed in together. The spiciness is very mild, so don't feel like you're going to need several glasses of water. I liked that the chicken thigh was deboned. It made cutting into it much easier and it guaranteed me layers of chicken + biscuit with every bite.\n\nThe sausage gravy was on point. I *LOVE* sausage gravy. In my opinion, it's the only way to have white gravy. Their sausage gravy is almost as good as mine. It's savory, salty, meaty, & rich-enough-to-clog-your-arteries good. Pair that with their flaky, buttery, biscuits, you have a Southern breakfast staple.\nMy favorite cocktail is the bloody mary. Honestly, it's just a plain bloody mary that didn't warrant the $10 price tag. For $10, I expect a near-kitchen sink type bloody mary. The pickled peppadew was sweet (like a red bell pepper) and pepperoncini add the tang\/subtle heat profile. It was rather small too, so I feel I should have gotten a different cocktail.\n\nIf you've never been to Biscuit Love, I would definitely give it a try. The line is a bit intimidating but honestly, it's not terribly bad. The food is great despite being a bit pricey, but then again, it's in the heart of The Gulch. You're paying to be there no matter where you go.","date":"2021-12-31 21:40:44"}

I'm also not the biggest fan of cold food, read: sandwiches. Therefore, I had a hard time finding something I'd like off Cafe La Maude's menu, but I definitely see the potential for people who like eggs, aren't lactose intolerant, aren't allergic to fruit, etc (I know, I have a lot of problems!).\n\nI got the steak frite sandwich, which was pretty good, but nothing to shout about. In fact, the bread was pretty hard and tired out my jaw, so I took half of it home and heated it up--it tasted infinitely better then! I especially liked the combination of steak, avocado, and mustard aioli. The fries were great and flavorful--but not in a normal, salted way! On the other hand, my boyfriend got the french toast (Berrylicious Pain Perdu), and it was so. beautiful. And he said it tasted as amazing as it looked! (Picture posted.) He definitely wants to come back for brunch again.\n\nThe service was excellent, and everyone was really friendly. They don't really assign a specific server to you, so the waitresses frequently check up on you to make sure you have everything you need--especially before you get your food. When I was there, people came out of the back and talked to customers they seemed to know.\n\nThe space is a little cramped, and the high-top tables in the front each have a tall chair and a spot on a long booth that goes against the wall.

We requested to be seated outside when a table opened and we were told we were at the top of the list. Immediately, we ordered drinks, queso\/chips, and our meals. Over the next hour, our drinks were delicious but everything else was a complete disaster. We watched many tables leave from outside and new groups go outside. Despite reminding the host and waitress kindly, they avoided us and when confronted they reassured us without following through. Our queso took an hour and 10 minutes to arrive at which point the queso was oily, crispy on the side, and impenetrable to reach; our chips crumbling trying to reach what we thought would be soft queso but was thickened strips of cheese. Kindly, we asked for a new order of queso because we were unable to enjoy the one before us. At this point, we were frustrated. After waiting for so long we had no food and were not being moved outside. I talked to the host, she told me they had a clear table she was about to bring us outside. 15 minutes went by and still no new queso, no outdoor table, and our food (2 paninis and a quesadilla) was probably an hour+ from arriving. I decided to get the check, which again took 10+ minutes until I approached the host where she had charged us for 2 Quesos. After the fix, I immediately paid. We talked with the manager who was extremely unprofessional. As someone who has worked in the industry, I understand things can become busy but communication is key. Rather than explaining or giving some clarification to the chaos or even apologizing, he became defensive and blamed the rush (that was no longer there after 2+ hours). When expressing frustration with the cost and experience not aligning he was shocked yet offered no kind resolution or peace offering of any sort.  \n\n\nI felt extremely bad for the staff. Clearly, there is a larger issue at hand on a business level. Others around us felt similar, many walking out and others closing their checks early and verbally expressing a lack of tip.

No flavor and mushy, Meatloaf tasted like dried out sausage and veal had no flavor ,pasta was mushy. Since we were visiting family that was the only good thing about the meal.","date":"2015-04-12 20:37:52"}

We found that place with Marlow's. My girlfriend can't get enough of the Prime Rib Dip. Even after multiple trips, that is all that I have ever seen her eat from the menu.\n\nIn the past, they have been cooking their burgers a little of the pink side. Tonight, it seemed as if they finally have it dialed in. The size is abundant and the taste is just right, all the way down to the last bite.\n\nOne of the treats that I really enjoy are the amazingly fresh pickles that are included on the plates as a condiment. The cucumber taste reminds me of my grandmother who used to grow her own cucumbers, then painstakingly jar her own pickles. The treats brings my senses to another place altogether.\n\nThe salads are probably my only active complaint. The lettuce is sliced so thin that it changes the texture of the leafy greens. Not necessarily bad tasting...it is just weird in your mouth.\n\nWednesday and Friday nights, they feature live acoustic music that sounds eerily similar to Mouse Rat (extra points if you can identify that reference). A little on the loud side for dinner music, but kudos for supporting live local music.\n\nMake sure you check in on Yelp for$5 off of your Bill of $15 or more.","date":"2018-07-28 02:41:36"}

We drove 10 minutes out of the way to eat here but it's what us and the kids all agreed to eat. 20 minutes later when we get there, not only is the food not ready but they know nothing about it. Why? Because no one was paying attention to the printer that prints the online orders so the ticket was just sitting there. The bartender tried to start the order, which is what made us aware that it hadn't been started or sent to the kitchen. My sister and I went outside to ask everyone if they wanted to wait but since it had already been 20 min ago since we put the order in and we would've had to wait 15-20 minutes more to get it they didn't want to...So my sister and I went back inside to get the card refunded. The manager, Johnny, goes to the back to do the refund and comes back like 4 minutes later saying he couldn't and has to call IT. That confuses me because we didn't have to call IT to charge the card so we had to leave our information so he could try to do it later and then call\/email us back.\nAs a manager, I would've had the kitchen drop the food while we went out the the car to see if everyone wanted to wait or not and ran a refund on the card anyway since it's the fault of the restaurant that the food isn't ready (not the customers). All we got was a lame \"I'm sorry about that\" and that's it. This is NOT how you run a restaurant. Because instead of him fixing our situation, we walked out with no food and no refund. Fixing the issue would've been a good thing but since it's not, this review will change the choice of future guests who may think about going here.

There are fresh veggies to choose from and everything is clean and prepared in front of you. They even have deserts and well chosen side items. \n\nWithout the coupon the pricing is decent. But I would go ahead and check in and check it out! It's a great alternative to grabbing a sandwich or some other fast lunch option, without having to go too greasy or leave you wanting more. Well...I could actually go for more...so if you'll just excuse me then...brb. Promise!","date":"2019-10-25 16:55:23"}

They had a strong smokey taste and were not as good as I expected them to be. We also ordered the sliders, Mac & cheese, and pulled chicken quesadillas. We were excited that the sliders gave us an opportunity to try the brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken. While the mac & cheese was tasty, the BBQ left a lot to be desired.

The roaring fire-place and leather couches in the dining room that are often filled with bar patrons make you forget that you're right under the El in Fishtown. The whole thing feels very upscale and cozy, albeit a bit loud with the proximity of the tables and the fact that there is not a clear distinction between the bar and dining room. \n\nFood: \nI'll start by saying I've never eaten anything bad here - everything they made is well executed and has come out flawless every time. Their kitchen definitely knows what they're doing and holds themselves to a high standard which shows the caliber of the restaurant and the attention to detail. The first time I came here several months ago I struggled to find something I liked on the menu - though now they've updated to feature a lot more dishes that I enjoy. My advice is to check out the menu ahead of time to make sure there are dishes that call out to you - while they do a great job of cooking not all of the dishes match my personal tastes. As this is an Italian restaurant, they offer a lot of seafood options and it seems to me there are several vegetarian and vegan options available as well. \n\nStand-outs for me are the brocolli rabe appetizer and the hanger and eggs for brunch - I don't normally like over easy eggs but they do them so well here I have to order it. \n\nDrinks: \nMuch like the kitchen - the bar here knows what they're doing and their cocktails are spot on in terms of balance and flavor. You can't go wrong here ordering a cocktail you like. The selection of beer and wine are standard Italian fare. They do not seem to have an extensive wine cellar or wine by the bottle offerings which may deter some folks, though I'm sure all of their wine by the glass can be purchased by the bottle as well even though not explicitly quoted on the menu. \n\nService:\nWhile it's clear the servers here are pulled from top notch establishments and have knowledge of the menu, the overall service lacks the refinement of a five-star establishment. My drinks tend to sit empty here for several minutes before being topped off and the little touches such as being offered spreads for my croissant or a steak knife are lacking unless I explicitly ask. For some of you this won't bother you, but I was a bit disappointed as having to go back and forth with the wait-staff can throw off the pace of a meal a good bit. That said - the service is definitely good and friendly. \n\nValue:\nWhy 4 stars? Everything is good here and well-made, however Wm Mulerhins lacks the magic to make this a 5 star experience. While I've never had a bad experience I've also never felt compelled to rave about this place to my friends either or to bring guests from out of town - it's kind of just a nice spot to eat when I don't feel like going to Center City. Some dishes are better value than others, but ultimately it's comparable if a little bit less than center city prices which is fine for what they offer and the neighborhood. I would say go value-wise, but for the reasons described not a place that I would use for a special occasion.","date":"2020-03-08 21:17:53"}

Warehouses during the 2000's I knew they were capable of holding a lot. But still I never quite expected them to house multiple fancy loft apartments, a delicatessen, and a huge brewery space. But as soon as I walked in and previewed how they refurbished the place it was something that made a whole lot of sense. Especially when I looked at the well rounded not too heavy on IPA beer list and saw how reasonably priced their flights were.\n\nAnd what a phenomenal list it was! for my first beer I was officially the 1st person to tap into their newly added sour and oh so decadently fruity Griotte, which managed to deliver a suitable taste of what I was in for. For my flight I was definitely impressed with their Crop Cover Rye IPA, the Heart in Hand Rauch Bock, and the deceptively smooth Bonne Anne 2017. But for me it was the Pat's Hat Honey Rye Porter that's aged in rye whiskey barrels that especially stole the show and earned a spot on my top 5 porters list.\n\nFor testing out new spots, my latest prerequisite food item of choice has been trying veggie wings when available. And while they were definitely sweet and delicious, I just found the ones with sweet gochujang sauce that I ordered to not hold a candle to others that I've had at other restaurants.

A friend and I split some hummus and shawerma, plus a falafel plate and the lamb kabob. Hummus was fine, not particularly awesome, but certainly not bad either. The beef shawerma has a nice crust on it, and was seasoned pretty well. The bread served along side was...bad. Very thin, chewy pita, with no real flavor. I hold all pita to the standard of Naf Naf, so I know no one will compare, but this was further towards the bad end of the scale than most. We got a second basket of it towards the end of the meal, and it was at least a little more leavened, but still kind of tough and flavorless.\n\nMy lamb was inconsistently done, and a little tough - OK flavor, but the cut just wasn't all that great. It was served on a large bed of rice that was well seasoned (with I think a little cardmom?) but not exceptional. The falafel plate was a large serving of about 10 falafel, but they featured very crisp outsides with kind of dry, crumbly insides. Not terribly well seasoned, not tender and moist like some I've had. Just...not great. Which really is the theme for most of this meal.\n\nI know there are a bunch of places in Chicago that are better than this - Naf Naf, Nesh, Benjehuda, even I Dream of Falafel, all available in the Loop for my lunch enjoyment.

He will ask you to to lie on different firmness levels and types of mattresses in the store, don't feel self-conscious. Do it! Once you find the firmness level and material you find most comfortable, he will ask you to try more mattresses of that kind.

It's also where the locals seem to go to have a fun time.  It's certainly classier than and away from the hustle and bustle of Bourbon Street.

(I do not recall whether that was the regular menu item or a special).  They offer an $8 red beans special on Mondays, with an optional side of andouille or fried chicken for an additional $4. I had the fried chicken, which is an uncoated Southern traditional preparation (i.e., without the thick Popeyes-style batter layer) that arrives fresh and hot from the fryer. It's some of the best fried chicken I've had in New Orleans.  The red beans and chicken appears to be a popular option, judging from a quick scan of the room during a Monday noontime.  \n\nThe redbeans are served with a garnish of fresh green onion. The beans tend toward the bland side, despite having a few slices of sausage in the mixture.  The beans seem lighter and less greasy than the typical local preparation, and that makes for an appropriate contrast if you choose to add  fried chicken or sausage.  \n\nThe burger is a nice sized thick patty that show no signs of having ever seen a freezer, served on a toasted bun.  The burger was good, but on this plate, the french fries were the standout: thin cut with skins in place and served just as hot and fresh as the fried chicken.  Our experience reminded us of how fried foods are best served moments after being rescued from the vat. High Hat appears to make this a priority, and does not allow fried chicken or fries to languish while  sublime hot crispiness cools down toward a mediocre warm and soggy.  \n\nThe side dishes are notable for being fresh and homemade. The cole slaw alongside the pork dish was crisp and tart and not overwhelmed by mayonnaise, providing a perfect balance against the meaty, rich pork.  Cornbread comes out in thick warm cubes perfectly browned on top and bottom.   \n\nThe desserts are homemade and interesting, often consisting of a seasonal citrus based custard pie (in our experience, orange and satsuma).  At $6, these items are expensive and not large--but since so many New Orleanian diners are just that,  it's just as well that the portion was just big enough for sharing.","date":"2011-10-31 18:50:58"}

There is no hesitation in giving Methodist Sports Medicine a 5 star review. I began experiencing hip pain about 6 months ago and had no idea what was the cause. I am an active individual in that I love running, cycling, going to the gym, doing interval training, being outside -- definitely an on-the-go person. So having hip pain when I was doing these activities was very upsetting. I ended up becoming good friends with a girl that had been experiencing the same symptoms and the cause of her pain was a labral tear. The other symptom I had was a \"clicking\" sound in my hip. She recommended I check out Methodist Sports Medicine to see if I had the same thing. Low and behold, I had a labral tear. She also highly recommended Dr. Peter Maiers. And now I'm to the point where I would highly recommend him as well.\n\nBefore my initial visit, I didn't even know that I had a labrum in my hip. (Body problems = improving my medical knowledge. haha) My doctor, Dr. G. Peter Maiers, explained to me that hip arthroscopy would be my best bet. I was experiencing femoroacetabular impingement (FAI), which is when bone spurs (bone overgrowth) around the socket or femoral head cause damage - which is what happened to me. I was told that it was definitely my choice as to whether or not I wanted to have surgery. If I was to wait, there would be a good chance that I would get arthritis in my hip sooner rather than later and that would most likely result in a hip replacement. At 26 years old, I felt that getting things fixed now would be best. Plus - I wanted to get back to my running without pain! \n\nDr. Maiers has been fantastic and I would recommend him to anyone. He specializes in hips, knees and focuses on getting you back to your active lifestyle. (Which is fantastic!) He's treated Colts players and was taught under the physician that first did this specific surgery. I trusted his knowledge from the beginning and knew that this would be the best route for getting my body back to \"normal.\" His assistant, Staci Eufemi, has been great with explaining everything thoroughly to me as well. I've had nearly a hundred questions for her (well, almost) that I've send via email and she has quickly responded to each of them. So appreciated!\n\nThe surgery itself went really well, which is obviously of high importance. All of the staff at Methodist Sports Medicine were super kind and helped me through every step. I honestly didn't realize how big of a surgery it would be -- just in terms of what recovery would be like for me. No, it's not a hip replacement, but it still involves a lot of recovery. Everything that needed fixed is now fixed (hooray!) and I'm still in the recovery period. A few weeks out and I'm definitely feeling better, but I promise you that it takes patience and so much rest. One life saver was the Recovery+ compression wrap that I rented for two weeks. I literally kept that thing on day and night. I HIGHLY encourage patients to take advantage of this ice machine (what I've called it from day 1) as it truly helps. \n\nAs for physical therapy, I encourage you to use their staff! All appointments (check-ups, surgery, PT) are in the same building, which makes it super convenient. I've been working with a PT named Andrea Wilson and she truly has been amazing. She explains all PT workouts thoroughly and understands the surgery I had inside and out. You have no idea how comforting that is - to work with someone that truly understands what they're saying. haha \n\nI plan to update this review once I get back to my normal routines - running, cycling, going for long walks, hikes, etc. I'm not a very patient person, so this has definitely been challenging for me. But - I'm thankful that I found this place to get me back in action.","date":"2015-05-27 16:31:41"}

I enjoyed all of the flavors, but there was this one flavor that wasn't my favorite . . the bartender was super nice and offered to replace my drink several times.  I explained to him that I just couldn't put my finger on the flavor and that I guessed that it was this herb.

But we were soon put at ease when our helpful waiter brought over Elsa lunch boxes filled with little toys (dinosaurs, cars, etch a sketch, crayons) goldfish crackers, and a kid's menu to color on. They were sad when they learned they couldn't have the toy boxes though, so you might want to give your kids a heads up about that. \n\nMy husband couldn't decide which beer to order as there are many choices. The waiter let him sample a few different ones in shot glasses so my husband could pick one that he really liked. I also wanted to drink something, but didn't want beer. The waiter suggested strawberry thyme kombucha from red feather next door (both restaurants owned together and connected in the middle). It was light and perfect, even the kids liked it. The glass it comes in looks kind of like a fancy wine glass. It has the bitter creek logo on it as well. They are available for 8$ if you want a souvenir. The kids got sodas in little mason glasses that come with cute little sippy lids (also cool). \n\nMy husband got a meat dish and enjoyed his meal. For the non meat eaters there is a hummus appetizer, veggie and hummus gyro, and a black bean burger. I got the black bean burger with a side salad. My meal was delicious. The kids ordered a grilled cheese meal with fries and a Mac n cheese meal with veggies. The Mac m cheese was the winner and the kids ended up sharing that. Each kids meal comes with a side(but the drink is not included.)\n\nFinally great service too, we will be back!","date":"2018-07-24 20:23:56"}

How many IPAs do you need in one place?! Ales, porters, stouts, wheats, sours, they've got them all.  \n\nThe last time I visited IMBĪB they were featuring sours. Sours are my favorite! I was able to try 6 different ones in a flight and the raspberry was my favorite. To be honest, sour beer doesn't really have a beer-like flavor to me but it sure tastes good!

I hadn't had breakfast. I'll take 2! ( Gotta feed the hubby!)  I had to wait about 5 minutes for them to be made, so we chatted. Most of their food is gluten free, and not full of stuff you can't pronounce. \n  Well, the burritos came with a drink and a cookie and were HUGE!

Eggs, sausage, potatoes, onions, cheese in a spinach tortilla. \n Oh yeah- the original reason for my visit and review- DONUTS!  First and foremost- yummy, cake donut with simple ingredients. You can definitely taste the applesauce. Not a bad thing. One of the 4 is chocolate, others are the same kinda applesauce cake flavor with different toppings. The cinnamon topping was my favorite. They are kinda heavy, but moist. If you are looking for an over-sugared, deep-fried donut, this ain't it.

I went to this office about a year ago (10\/17) and had a really negative experience. The office is really nice and had a lot of decorations but the doctor I saw was not good. I have a fear of dentists and let them know this in advance. I saw  Dr. Patel and he was really nice and comforting at first but it didn't last. After looking at my xrays and giving an exam he said he saw 4 main quadrants of concerns and that I would need to have fillings done. I asked how many cavities and he said \"I don't want to freak you out so I don't want to give a specific number.\" I asked again and he still wouldn't give a specific number of cavities he saw but kept repeating that he saw areas of concern. I was speechless and didn't know how to respond. When I checked out they asked me to schedule my next appointment to get started on the cavities and I asked how many there were and she said 11. I was shocked. I didn't have any pain except minor pain in 1 tooth that was off and on. I was stunned and left to go back to work. I ended up calling back and talking to the receptionist (Danita) about how I thought it was unprofessional that he refused to tell me how many cavities I had. She repeatedly made excuses for him instead of hearing my concerns and talked over me. He ended up calling me back but I didn't want to talk to him because I felt the trust was already broken. I shouldn't have to get information from the receptionist because the doctor refuses to answer my questions. Also, if someone has a cavity it's billed per tooth so there should be transparency between the doctor and patient  so that the patient has an idea of how much everything is going to cost. \n\nI finally went to see another dentist who took new xrays and compared the xrays I had taken here. She saw no cavities only 2 teeth we need to watch and told me she was glad I didn't go back to this place.  The only thing I'm appreciative of is that they prescribed me toothpaste which I believe helped reverse some of the demineralization in my teeth. \n\nIf you go here, please be careful or they might try to rip you off. I'm so grateful I decided to not come back here.","date":"2020-10-19 17:44:18"}

So when I saw that We Are Scientists (love them!) were playing 2 shows back to back, I decided to check at least one out, and hit up the bar for a bite to eat and couple drinks before the show. And when it comes down to it The Boot might not just be the best smaller scale music venue in Philly, its also the best venue to enjoy a meal at!\n\nfrom the GIANT boot sign out front; to bull ropes, full wooden tables, and elaborate cowboy art; the decor is full on wild wild west. And whats even more amazing about it is how faithful and unchanged the R5 Productions\/Four Corners Management crew kept it from the bar's old school line dancing days. Add in the spot on service and you have some flawless ambiance which carries over in the impressive food and drink menu, and you have a winning destination.\n\nFor the first bite we were completely amazed by the fried beef chips, which were essentially tiny country fried steaks among a plate slathered in green onion jam and house made ketchup. Good to the last bite and a hard one to resist licking the entire plate clean afterwards! While I was VERY tempted to revisit the octopus that I savored at the Elite Event, or join my dining partner in digging into the decadent pierogies with  cheddar, beef kielbasa, caramelized onions, and creme fraiche; I couldn't help but find myself drawn to the turkey burger. Normally I find myself disliking the dryness of turkey burgers compared to regular or veggie. But the combination of duck fat and chili relish managed to give it a bit of heat and pizzazz that was balanced out by the tang of the roasted apple mayo. Add in fries and a house pickle that could have been just a touch crisper, and I was left pleasantly fulfilled.\n\nThe beer list has plenty of favorites from the likes of Elysian and Ommegang on draft, as well as a widespread selection of cans that are perfect to take in for a show. The cocktail list manages to bring out the best in Art in the Age's standards, but the bartenders are capable of mixing on the fly as needed. The sound for the venue is absolutely flawless and among the best in the city, and the close proximity to the stage that you can maintain leads to the making of plenty of memorable concert moments in the making.","date":"2014-04-18 05:40:18"}

We ordered our drinks and got a free appetizer (thanks to foursquare), they gave us bread also which was not bad and the appetizer came out, but after that I seriously dont know what was up with our dinner!? it took almost 45 mins to an hour for our food to come back.

We actually had to complain about it which the server was nice enough to change out the salad for a brand new one (this time the scallops were cooked alright but still not that great) the sprite she first got was flat almost like a tonic water, then the second one she got was fizzy but just tasted funny). my two friends who ordered the steak dish were totally not pleased both ordered medium rare but had two inconsistent steaks and meat that didnt come out piping hot, almost as if it was sitting under a lamp until the other dishes were ready. the meatloaf dish was okay, lobster ravioli was nothing special, and my free range chicken was probably the only decent dish there.\n\nthe service was pretty good which probably only reason why my friends didnt complain about our meal, the server even took off the gratuity for our party but we still gave him the tip he deserved but for the restaurants food itself it was LACKING big time! honestly for the prices it was definitely not worth it.

Lots of humor, good music and, for some, good wine all contributed to the festive feel that went a long way towards eliminating any apprehensions.\n\nThe instruction is minimal but that is the point.

Rather than trying to get people to duplicate an idea or copy a painting, the real fun is in liberating participants to fearlessly try, boldly experiment and unleash their inner, more unconventional artist.\n\nThis is a great activity for individuals, couples, groups and just anyone who likes art, admires art but has never really considered themselves capable of creating art. \n\nI can't wait to go back and be a little more fearless and really allow myself to think outside the box and color outside the lines.","date":"2014-08-15 02:23:50"}

The price is good.  On my latest visit I asked to have my hair dyed.  Price was $25.00 as listed on their price display board at the front desk.  Student who did my hair did an excellent job.  When she brought out the the bowl with the hair dye it looked low to me, but I stupidly did not say anything.  My hair is cut just above my jaw line.  Well after she covered up the roots she needed more of the dye and told me it would be $10 for an extra bowl.  I said I have had my hair colored many times at this salon and never was there a need for a second bowl of color.  She said the color is mixed by the instructors.  I said I noticed the bowl was low.  She said yes, it did look low to her, but students do not mix the color, the instructor does.  Please note this person did apply the color correctly.  At the same time a women across the room who was also having her hair colored was asking the same thing why do I need and have to pay for a second bowl of color when I never have in the past.  IT IS OBIVIOUS THEY ARE PUTTING LESS COLOR IN THE BOWL.  When I left and paid my bill with a credit card including the extra $10 for the second bowl of color, I asked the cashier if they are putting less color in the bowl.  She said oh no, no.  I said yes the amount is less.  She said I needed to speak to a Manager.  There were several people waiting so I left and called Empire Beauty School and Salon the next day and spoke to the Manager.\nShe insisted the amount of color has not changed, and she mixed the color herself personally.  I asked why  the first bowl seem to be filled more than the first, she said it wasn't.  I told her it visibly was.  She also said maybe I need more dye if my roots had grown longer.  I told her this does not make sense since I always  have my whole head colored and my hair has acutally been longer in the past , and only one bowl was used.  I suggested perhaps she made a mistake on measuring the first bowl, but she said that she did not.  I told her I would let my credit card company pay the $25 but would be disputing the $10 for the second bowl.  She told me to do what I have to do and to have a nice day.  IF YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED THE SAME PROBLEM PAYING FOR A SECOND BOWL WHEN YOU DID NOT IN THE PAST, PLEASE POST YOUR EXPERIENCE HERE.  Also,  why is it the students do not have disinfectant to clean there combs, brushes, etc after each use???  Why do they not soak your nails during a manicure.  Are they sterilizing the tools???  I will have to research these facts with the State of Pa. Dept. of Health and or Insurance.  One last note,  the Manager said they mix 2 ounces of color and 2 ounces of the activator for a total of 4 ounces.  I will be calling other salons to see if this is the amount they use.  MY ADVICE TO YOU IS TO ASK THEM IF ONE BOWL IS ENOUGH TO DO YOUR HAIR BEFORE YOU HAVE YOUR HAIR HALF COVERED WITH COLOR.  DON'T LET THEM GIVE YOU A LINE SAYING THEY DON'T KNOW AND EVERYONE'S HAIR IS DIFFERENT. A WELL TRAINED STYLIST SHOULD KNOW.  \nCC:LEGAL FILE\nCC:STATE OF PA\/ DEPT.

We ordered small plates only, to sample some of everything: fries w\/ the pickled okra dipping sauce, pork belly steam buns, chicken & mushroom gumbo, squash salad, and boudin balls.

What was weird however was they didn't have any to-go containers...our waitress packed our leftover gumbo in a paper coffee cup. Tacky. Another waiter gave us free mixed shots from the bar because my mom was nice and helped him locate the wine glasses next to us (he couldn't see them because they were low).

It was pretty empty when we arrived and plenty of parking and open tables. We were greeted once entering the restaurant and seated as well. For a Korean bbq joint this place is very clean and it doesn't have that meat lingering smell like some Korean bbq places do. Now let's get to the food...\n\nMe and my girl both order the dinner ayce (all you can eat) which was a decent price. We started off with the spicy pork belly and the miso pork belly. Honestly the spicy pork belly was well seasoned but the miso didn't really have a taste. Next was a round of seafood which consisted of shrimp, octopus and calamari. Out of those three the calamari was our favorite. Very tender and well seasoned. I'll definitely recommend the calamari if you're into that! Last but not least was a round of beef. The highlight was the boneless beef short ribs. Soooo good! I ordered about 3 more times of that because the portions here are small which is a good thing. Helps you not waste food and also gives you the opportunity to try different things. Shout out to our waitress, she's was amazing and was A1 the whole light! This Korean bbq place had the best customer service out of any ayce Korean bbq I've been too! That says a lot!

I realize that's a pretty broad statement, and that art is a subjective medium but art galleries aren't really my thing. I look at a painting and usually the things that come to my mind are adjectives like; neat, weird and thoughts such as, \"I like that colour of blue paint.\" I'm never able to comprehend what an artist is trying to say about himself\/herself or society in general. \n\nDespite this I've been to the new Art Gallery of Alberta three times. Once with a friend after it first opened. Then to check out the Escher and Looney Tunes exhibit, and finally again with another friend to see the Andy Warhol exhibit. \n\nI love that Edmonton has such a beautiful and unique space to display art from all over the world. I think the AGA has done a great job of bringing in art exhibits that will attract a wide range of people, from art aficionados, to people like me who don't really get art. There's an art area for kids, more traditional art, and even interactive art. One of my favourite exhibits on my last visit was the interactive silver cloud exhibit. I don't know what it was supposed to mean, but it was fun.  \n\nAdult admission is $12.50 but if you're a student or senior you'll only pay $8.50. Alternatively you can check out the AGA on the last Thursday of each month from 6pm to 8pm when admission is free. However; the free night gets busy, so if you like to take your time looking through a gallery and\/or you want to avoid crowds then this won't be your best choice.  \n\nYou can drive to the AGA and park at a nearby parkade, like the one at the library. But I recommend taking the LRT because the AGA is right next to Churchill Station. Take the escalator from the platform of the lrt station and at the top you'll see the entrance that goes to the AGA. \n\nThe AGA has a restaurant, Zinc, which I haven't been to. There's a rooftop space with different sculptures. It's not a huge, but day it give a nice view of Churchill Square and city hall. Plus the standard gift store featuring a variety of souvenirs, including postcards of the when the AGA was being built (which I thought was kinda neat). They also have souvenirs relating to the exhibits that are occurring at the time, books, and products from local artists, like Sushi Papercraft journals (disclaimer: I know the artist behind Sushi Papercraft but I still really love the journals). \n\nThe next time I come to the AGA I'm going to book a tour to learn more about what I'm seeing. Maybe I'll finally understand art, and maybe it'll always be something I don't really get. Either way I'll come back to the AGA and have a nice time trying to figure it out.","date":"2011-08-13 18:50:42"}

My big bro @eldee_arr is the master chef of this establishment and he brings his own twist on urban cuisine which is absolutely delicious. While here, I ordered the henny lemonade in both passionfruit and strawberry flavors. Both were super good and you can barley taste the alcohol . For food I ordered the fried shrimp with french fries and the infamous chicken Cesar salad . The shrimp and fries were seasoned perfectly and they were huge! The salad was dumb delicious with a burst of flavor in every bite! The blueberry mint hookah was also good! Wasn't too strong at all; and easy to puff on . If you ever find yourself in Chinatown wanting to escape please check out this dope establishment @daynnitephilly and check out the big bro @eldee_arr perfected dishes! Oh and duh  tell them that shimmy sent you!  #philadelphia #philly #chinatown #drinks #hookah #hookahlounge #hennessy #strawberry #passionfruit #shrimp #fries #frenchfries #friedshrimp #salad #cesarsalad #blueberry #mint #water #foodphilly #food #foodie #foodphotography #foodstagram #foodporn #goodeats #brother #vibes  #bar","date":"2021-04-29 20:39:25"}

Our host was attentive, gave good suggestions, and was patient. He handled us like a pro. I later told the manager of how satisfied we were with his service.\n\nThe menu had delicious offerings, all made from scratch. Each person enjoyed what they received from bacon cheeseburgers, to fish tacos, to chicken entrees. The food was so flavorful and satisfying. It was portioned well too. I ordered the fish tacos and it was tasty and filling. The fries that came with it were great. They were so kind to offer me dessert of my choice. I thought, \"wow this is so nice\" and made my experience much more pleasing.

And then you watch them create a beautiful drink and you will give them even more money. And then you taste the drink! Okay. All the money. They get it. Take it. It's theirs. \n\nThe service was also super accommodating and kind. The place could easily lean into the pretentious category but they didn't from my experience at all. In fact I got nothing but welcoming vibes. Is that southern hospitality? Maybe. \n\nSometime my guy and I like to play a game where we order each other's drinks and guess what they will pick. Sometimes this can be annoying. Instead of ordering like a normal civilized human, we point to menus and make weird gestures with our eyes. They had no problem with our shenanigans. Because they are using QR codes for menus (touchless) it was pretty easy to just show them the phone. \n\nI loved this spot. Prepare to spend some money. But this is like Disney World for adults. You are buying an experience! WORTH IT.","date":"2021-02-19 00:31:24"}

The people are very kind, and that never changed. What I ended up being unhappy with was the constant scheduling issues and actual dental work. I had three appointments for fillings rescheduled because of scheduling problems in the office. After the third time this happened, I moved to a new dentist. The new practice took NEW x-rays because Castle Dental never sent over my records, only to show me that THERE ARE CAVITIES UNDER THREE OF THE FOUR FILLINGS I HAD DONE AT CASTLE DENTAL. Two of those fillings were already re-done at the Castle Dental office because they chipped, had to be drilled out and re-filled. Funny thing, I have several fillings older than these that I've never had a problem with. And another fun fact: during my last cleaning at Castle Dental, the hygienist who cleaned my teeth told me I got a filling (from Castle Dental) THAT I DIDN'T EVEN NEED. I also never appreciated feeling like I was being sold on treatments I didn't feel I needed (I just chalked that up to it being a corporate office), the personal conversations my dentist had with her assistant while I was having dental work done, or that my dentist smelled of cigarette smoke.

Normally I am completely satisfied.  Last night however,was an exception. First, it was burger night so I thought a burger sounded good. Our meal started after our party arrived in three separate groups. I do understand that this may cause confusion but the hostess was told of the number of people in our party. So, as I was saying, once everyone arrived, we ordered appetizers. They were good and brought out quickly. This is however when things began to go south. Along with the appetizers a stack of dishes and silverware were set in the middle of the table. Problem was there were less dishes and silverware than guests at the table. No extra napkins. Then when the food came and almost everyone ordered burgers it was a struggle to get silverware for everyone. Again napkins were requested. The burger I got was so greasy I only took two bites. With no napkins my hands were covered in grease. I ended up using a napkin that was already used by my mother just to be able to clean my hands. Condiments were never brought to the table which I thought was crazy because almost everyone in our party ordered burgers! Finally, my glass was empty halfway through the meal but I was not offered a refill. In conclusion, I don't know what went wrong last night but I was left wondering if this experience was a sign of a bad night or an indication of a much deeper problem. I do know that if your restaurant is offering a featured dish - that dish should leave the kitchen as the best example of that category on your menu in hopes that it will inspire you to order from that category on future visits. The reality of my experience last night was the entire experience had no inspiration in any area of the visit. Not the food, service, or the atmosphere inspired me. In conclusion, I will return to McGlynns again in the coming weeks because after many good meals I am hoping that my experience last night was an anomaly. Even the best restaurants have an off night. I wrote this review in hopes that the staff reads this and work to eliminate the possibility that any patron will have a meal like I did last night. Also, I know that they have the ability to do so much better.","date":"2021-11-03 15:52:54"}

Do not stay here. Ever.\nI don't have a good thing to say about this hotel. The staff is rude and unhelpful. I tried to check in for a 5 night stay at 9:30PM and my room wasn't even ready (check in is at 3PM by the way, and I'd had the reservation for weeks). No caffeinated coffee in the room and after I asked for coffee to be brought up to the room, no coffee was ever brought. The room phone didn't even work for me to call reception. I then accidentally left 3 shirts hanging in my hotel room closet and called at 11AM, within hours of checking out, to find them and talked to the manager Savannah who promised me housekeeping would call me that day -they never called. I called back at 5PM and spoke to a gentleman who claimed to not have access to the housekeeping closet to look for the shirts and to call back the next morning at 8AM. The next day when I called, the manager Savannah stated, 'we can't find them, there were no shirts in the room.' I informed her yes they were 100% in the room, I do not have them. She was mean and rude and when I stated what the nighttime manager told me the night before, she said 'That's a lie.' So, calling me a liar. Repeatedly saying, 'Sorry YOU left YOUR shirts in the closet, they weren't there.' So, apparently housekeeping or someone threw out or accidentally took my shirts. She never once apologized until I asked for an apology. This is awful treatment someone who is supposed to be the manager, the leader of the hotel, can give to a guest. This hotel is a shame to the Marriott family. Sadly my shirts were 'never found' which Savannah claims is 'my fault for leaving them in the room because she is not responsible.' I was promised hotel points for compensation (which I haven't received yet...) after I had to beg and plead for something to be given and point out what an awful experience this is as a guest and how as a manager she has handled this situation poorly every step of the way. Do not stay here. Ever.","date":"2021-11-07 16:03:13"}

I talked to Aaron Stutman, a public adjuster in my business club that worked for Metro and he said he would take a look at the problem. He studied the cause of the leak which was our central drain pipe that had sprung a leak from age and he evaluated damages it caused. He also discovered that a drain pipe from my upstairs bathroom had also caused damage and he ultimately filed both claims as one thus bypassing a second deductible. An expert auditor from the company came and added up the damages. They were professional and did all of the legwork in addition to meeting with the insurance company adjuster. I would not have been inclined to file a claim if it weren't for Aaron and Metro taking care of everything. \n\nA second problem I had was my air conditioner downstairs. The pan was rusted and that caused a leak that went all over my cellar. There was damage to the tiles. After the good experience I had with the first leak, I called Aaron again and he looked it over while making no promises. They negotiated again with the insurance company and we made a decent recovery. I again would not have had the time or perseverance to have made a claim on my own and followed through with the paperwork. Aaron and Metro again did all of the work and I just had to sign the check.\n\nA third issue I had and by far the most expensive was damage to my roof from wind. I went out the door after one of our recent serious wind storms perhaps related to climate changes only to discover a handful of shingles on my front lawn. I thought I might try to have a few of the shingles replaced, but then remembered that Aaron had mentioned roof repair at one of our meetings. I asked him about it and again he said he couldn't promise anything but that he would look into it. He went up on the roof with our public adjuster after having his own people review the problem and he asked me to get an estimate on the repair. He also suggested including our 2 large sheds in the repair and I agreed that if he could that would be fantastic. One of my patients has a great reputation for quality roof repair so I got an estimate from him and Aaron took it to our insurance company. A short time later, I got a check covering 4\/5 of the work. I had the job done, it looks great and Aaron got them to send me another check. At this point I just about broke even and it included both of my sheds. The building looks great and once again they did all of the work.

Wooters exceeded our expectations, as did many other details of the eclectically decorated space. Large indoor and outdoor seating options can easily accommodate large parties, but one of the most remarkable details I noticed immediately upon being seated was the comfort of the chairs in the main dining room. As a veteran of two spine fusions, comfortable dining furniture is often overlooked in most restaurants. The four top offered rounded, fully-backed upholstered chairs with ample cushioning making our 2 1\/2 hour dining experience extremely enjoyable and comfortable. Both my friend and I are small in stature, and our feet could easily reach the floor. I wish more restaurants would invest in comfortable, upholstered chairs for diners instead of hard wooden seats.\n\nWe started off with Steak Tartare and Toritos Cangrejos. The Tartare was accompanied by an array of escabeche vegetables and chimichurri, all to be devoured with fried plantain strips. Both the escabeche vegetables and chimichurri were outstanding, and we asked for more chimichurri as the portion on the plate was a little scarce. The server quickly delivered. Each element on this plate complimented the raw beef perfectly with acidity and color, and I could have easily gone for another side of the vegetables solo, but I had to pace myself. The Toritos are three bacon-wrapped fresh Caribe Chiles stuffed with herbed goat cheese over a bright yellow Cholula-lime aioli. I've never had a Caribe Chile before, and I am now a huge fan. My friend mentioned shying away from anything bacon wrapped, but this dish was sublime. The bacon was not only perfectly cooked, but it was also thinly sliced so it was crisp-tender and didn't overtake the dish. The fresh Caribe Chile and creamy goat cheese were the star, and the sauce offered a perfectly acidic, bright yellow contrast. \n\nThe entrees: Confit Pata de Pato (Duck) and Coconut-Crusted Snapper. My duck was cooked perfectly and sat over a chipotle-agave glaze. Although the sauce was sweet, there was nice bite from the chipotle Chile at the finish. It came with thickly sliced plantains, halved baby potatoes, Torino pork (lardons) with sautéed kale. Every element was complimentary, but the plantains were a bit woody and hard, maybe a tad underripe - my only disappointment. My friend's snapper was to die for, served with cauliflower chicharrones, dates, sautéed kale, piñon nuts over a lemon-manchego cream. The snapper was crusted and cooked perfectly - flaky, tender and MOIST! Don't skip this dish. It's beautiful and elegant.\n\nWe were stuffed, but I had to order a dessert, so we tried the lemon-coconut flan. This was a flan like neither one of us had ever had. The texture was very firm unlike most flans, but the creamy texture was smooth and very refined, almost like a crème brulée, but stiffer texture. There was more of a hint of lemon than coconut, and both flavors were extremely subtle. It came with fresh berries, whipped cream, and very large gingerbread cookie in the shape of a pig. The cookie was a subtle gingerbread, but a bit thick and dry, and I could only eat half. The sauce was very good, but can't for the life of me remember what it was. A reminder to snap the menus so I have them for reference.\n\nThey have live mariachi music, but it's not your standard mariachi. They sang and played some American songs as well, and their music was extremely enjoyable. They were packing up as we were leaving, and the guitar player was strumming a Led Zeppelin tune before casing his instrument. I couldn't remember the name of the song, so after guessing its name and album it was on, he played a few riffs of different Zeppelin songs for a continued guessing game. Just a nice, unexpected end to the evening. Will definitely return to try the other outstanding items on this menu - there are many to choose from. Vegan diners are welcome here. \n\nChef Wooters never disappoints since her debut at McClintock's at Saguaro Ranch many moons ago, then moving on to Jax, The Abbey, Jackson Kitchen, Commoner and Co., and Alloro AOC and the Hilton East. Her thoughtful array of ingredients, colors, sauces, and plating have only elevated over the years and I have always been a huge fan of her food. She definitely made this a meal to remember. \n\nThis space is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Can't wait to return.","date":"2021-07-03 16:43:25"}

Instead Santa grabbed his bell and insisted on waking my son up. After already waiting in line for 30 minutes he then suggested we get back in line to allow my son to wake up and be happier. Honestly a crying scared picture of Santa is like initiation I would've laughed bought it and still sent it on our Christmas cards. After doing a few with him fist bumping Santa and switching out our kids alone with Santa and a family one the photographer said she got some good ones. It took way too long after to get the pictures processed and there were only 2 pictures to chose from? A family one and 1 of my youngest son, what happened to the ones of my oldest fist bumping with Santa etc.??? I really just wanted the digitals because obviously that's the era we're in and so we got the best package and the lady charged my card after I reminded her we had already paid the $24.99. And after she stated yes I'll only be charging you $30 something. Okay swipe and $50 charge goes through. I ask she says the other will come off of my bank statement. We're supposed to get a Shutterfly credit, digitals and prints with this package. After 24 hours no digital pictures were available I couldn't even log on. I waited another day to give them extra time still no luck. I reach out to cust service exactly as they state to. I got an automated message saying they are reviewing my request. After a day with no response I messaged again looking for answers and after another 24 hours get a response that says I should wait 24 hours after the session to see if I get them... at this point it has been over 3\/4 days. If they would've looked they could've seen the attachments to my email of the posted charges showing I did in fact get charged extra and that me date the photos were taken as well as other attachments giving them every piece of information I have. Another response from them: sorry you had problems logging into the website we've fixed it, we're closing the ticket. (No mention of being over charged even with the shown proof in attachments) Go to log in and I can finally access the website to view my digital photos and I could actually log in this time.... only to see a watermarked photo telling me to pay to download my digitals????!!! Had I not already paid for this? Still waiting on my next email response which I'm sure will continue to not meet the expectations of this purchase. Absolutely ridiculous experience.

And for that, you get a one star review. Management is ass on every other shift as well so I'm not surprised.","date":"2021-08-26 04:26:17"}

Great prices.\n\nThe produce worker helped me find the 3 types of apples needed for a fresh apple pie. We needed Pink Lady, gala and golden delicious. The apples were not labeled correctly and he apologized. He then offered to help us find other stuff. This service went above what I usually see at discount grocery stores. \n\nIn the butcher area, I needed to find a 20 lb turkey and the largest I found was 16 lbs.

(¿dónde está?)\nIt's everything I wish I ate back home\nExcept you give me something\nI can eat.... eeeeeeeeeeeeat\n\nIf this deli were my mind, it'd be called Dirty Marte.\n\nUnbelievably good sandwiches available 24 hours a day (although sometimes they're cleaning the grill late at night). If there's only one thing you ever eat in the French Quarter, it simply has to be this.\n\nIt's also one of those things to which I've sent at least a dozen different people over the years, and whereas most of my recommendations will get a high success rate but not perfect, this one has been 100% all the way. Every single person I sent in here has come away being amazed.\n\nAll this despite there being nowhere in here to eat and it being a dingy little Bodega grocery store basically.\n\nIf eating here improves your mood and makes you chatty, it's Perky Marte.\n\nThe grill in the back is open 24 hours a day (except for cleaning which is usually sometime between 2 a.m. and 4 a.m. or something like that).\n\nAll That Jazz is the famous sandwich which I grew up absolutely loving, and would get every time I came to New Orleans. I just tried Ernie's Power House and I have to say it's even better. Same style, same taste, but different and better ingredients than the infamous ATJ.\n\nIf you come here with glasses on and tell everyone about your fave apps, it's Nerdy Marte.\n\nEverything they make at this Deli is incredible, and considering how big and filling these sandwiches are, it's well worth the $10 or so for each sandwich. Try this and Parkway when you come to New Orleans.\n\nThe reason why New Orleans has the best food places in the country is not the expensive crap that tourists and TV shows rave about. It's this and places like it.\n\nThe night is full of hos\n'Cause bullets rip the sky with black and gold\nThey twinkle as the boys play rock and roll\nThey know that they can't dance, at least they know\nI can't stand the beat, I'm asking for the check\nGirl with crimson nails has beads around her neck\nSwinging to the music, swinging to the music (whoa, whoa)\n\nHello, hello (hola)\nI'm at a place called Verti Marte! (¿dónde está?)\nIt's everything I wish I ate back home\nExcept you give me something\nI can eat.... eeeeeeeeeeeeat\n\nAfter all this time went by I expected this place to not be as good as my memory suggested. But everyone I've sent in the ensuing years said it's one of the best sandwiches they ever had.\n\nSo I ventured here and I checked out my beloved All That Jazz sandwich, which is still the best. Ever. And then a second time, only to realize that I don't really love the stuff that's on that sandwich so I switched it up and got Ernie's, which replaces the lunch meat with pork loin and the American Swiss cheese with pepper jack.\n\nSo incredibly good that despite having bloated tummies from a day of eating, we ended up devouring in the entire thing, the perfect bread, the gooey cheese, the incredible shrimp, yummy pork loin, veggies and dripping messy juicy sauces.\n\nAnd if you're Pakistani and come here, it's Urdu Marte.\n\nNot only the best specialty Innovative sandwich in Louisiana, but also one of the top 10 sandwiches of any kind in the whole country. When in N.O., don't say NO to this, or Parkway, or Tan Dinh, or Tessie's Diner, or even Cafe Du Monde.\n\nWhen you add in the fact that they are 24h, have quirky service, and fair prices, located right in the French Quarter, it goes off-charts. Even if the sandwich was only available for 1 hour day at lunch time it would still be one of the best there is.\n\nThere's nowhere to sit in here though, but make sure you eat it hot, as it's best eaten hot much like my Barbie. She's my Slurpie Marte.\n\nAnd if it's dark outside, go instead to Murky Marte. And if you're a Star Trek fan, go instead to Kirky Marte. And if Barbie gives you the gift that keeps on giving, it's Herpy Marte.\n\nAll this sandwich, all of this can be yours\nAll this sandwich, all of this can be yours\nAll this sandwich, all of this can be yours\nJust give me Ernie's Power House, and no one gets any\n\nHello, hello (hola)\nI'm at a place called Verti Marte! (¿dónde está?)\nIt's everything I wish I ate back home\nExcept you give me something\nI can eat.... eeeeeeeeeeeeat\nThis sandwich makes me so full\nThat I squeal\nAnd I kneel\nAnd I feel\nLike I ate too much\n(blurgh)\n\nAnd if you ejaculate in your pants when you eat this sandwich, it's Spermy Marte.","date":"2020-08-18 22:36:40"}

I think this place deserves a 3* primarily because of the service.\n\nI ordered a sesame crusted ahi tuna sandwich with onion rings instead of the chips it said it came with.  The portion was a large 6 oz (?) tuna filet - but it was more rare than I requested, so I asked for it to be cooked slightly more.  No problem, and without my asking, the management took off 50% off the price, and did not charge me for the onion rings.  I was impressed.  \n\nAs for the food --- it's not the main attraction, unless you are a big fan of Applebee-type food.  The onion rings were hot from the fryer when my sandwich first came out... but since they went back to the kitchen with my tuna, they returned lukewarm -- wish they would have either left them with me or replaced them with hot ones!  The tuna steak was obviously some pre-frozen, pre-sesame crusted fish served on a big, fluffy institutional white bread bun on top of about 5 leaves of spring mix.

My friend ordered the steamers -- they looked okay too, though the bread also looked like some soft italian bun.

I mean, they grow their own fruits and veggies and brew their own kombucha! Even though it's not a vegan restaurant, there were plenty of vegan options. It's rare when I find a place in this city that offers vegan pizza or vegan desserts, so major bonus points for that.\n\nI opted for a spicy chicken burrito bowl for my first visit, which was pulled chicken, a green spring mix, \"nice rice,\" black beans and avocado.

For that reason, you will notice some similarities between the menus but Off Broadway Deli has additional specialty sandwiches, their own soup recipes, and they use different seasoning\/batter for their chicken. \n\nOne of the reasons why I most wanted to visit this deli is because they are known for their extensive list of homemade soups, which they rotate through. They usually offer two soups a day but for my first visit on 11\/9\/21, they had three. Homemade soup is one of my favorites and I could happily eat it every day, so I ordered a bowl of each. The soup comes in two sizes, a cup for $2.99 or a bowl for $5.09. I got Jalapeño Bacon Beer Cheese, Bacon Cheeseburger, and Loaded Baked Potato. I also ordered a drumstick and some fries. Off Broadway Deli has homemade fry sauce, as well as regular and spicy ketchup, which is like cocktail sauce. I got a little of each.\n\nAll of the soups had good flavor. My favorite was a tossup between the Loaded Potato and the  Jalapeño Bacon Beer Cheese. The drumstick and fries were excellent, as was the fry sauce. \n\nOff Broadway Deli usually posts their daily soups on their FB page. If not, just give them a call and they'll be happy to tell you their daily soups. Their soup repertoire includes the following:\nChicken Pot Pie\nLemon Artichoke \nChili\nBBQ Chicken \nSausage & Cabbage \nChicken Tortilla \nCrab Bisque \nChicken Cordon Bleu\nCheesy Cauliflower \nCream of Broccoli \nPotato, Ham & Corn Chowder\nCream of Asparagus \nTomato\nBuffalo Bacon Cauliflower \nChicken Poblano \nSwedish Meatball \nClam Chowder \nChicken Enchilada \nMaple Ham & Bean\nChicken Verde\nSplit Pea w\/ Ham\n\nAddress: \n3369 S.

Parking was in a small lot across the street or on the street itself.\n\nSouthern Fresh had nice outdoor seating areas as well as a nice indoor dining room. We opted to sit outside.  We arrived at just the right time - shortly after our arrival, several people came to eat and had to wait - on a Tuesday evening!  Wow! I have to say that the atmosphere is true to the name of the restaurant.  Southern. Loved the Southern feel to it.\n\nWe opted for appetizers before our meal. Hubby ordered the BLT soup and I ordered the jumbo cold shrimp.  Hubby raved about the soup. I would have tried it but it was full of crunchy stuff (ie. lettuce, garlic, etc.).  He repeated how good it was, though.  My shrimp cocktail was super tasty, too.  Five large jumbo shrimp.  For our entrees, Hubby ordered the signature fried chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy and green beans. I ordered the grilled meatloaf which came with mashed potatoes and gravy and grilled asparagus.  Where do I start.  The fried chicken was okay. To me, it wasn't a WOW moment. Hubby agreed. I guess after hearing people talk about it, I expected heavenly explosion on my taste buds. I was disappointed.  The meatloaf was good. Not amazing but good. Mashed potatoes with gravy -- mashed potatoes were stiff, not creamy and they served a brown-ish gravy.  I'm a milk gravy kind of girl so I was a little disappointed that a place known for its fried chicken didn't serve milk gravy, but okay.  Hubby's green beans were a bit crunchy. Good flavor but undercooked.  My asparagus was very good, however.\n\nOverall, the bill came to just under $50.00 for two appetizers, two entrees and two non-alcoholic drinks.  This is typically what we pay when we go out so we weren't surprised by the price.  I gave it three stars.  It was okay but we both left with the same feeling that we wouldn't want to come back, especially since we drove from Tarpon Springs to eat there.

The art for beers like Ludwig's Revenge, Lovitz Watermelon Lager, and Laydown Stay Down could definitely be placed in a pop art museum. So when I heard that they were opening a brewpub in the Eraserhood I was instantly ready to give it a shot. And I love that the wacky murals, sports art installations, and even communal sitting arrangements play to the Liquid Art theme.\n\nFor beers the affordable flight deals have allowed me sample a huge variety. Fans of boozy beers will instantly be down with their rum barrel aged Captain Bill's Barleywine and the barrel aged Psychedelic Strawberry Belgian sour. IPA fans can't go wrong with the Step Up Your Game New England, Belgian Fans can Mind Your P's and Q's with a solid tripel, and regular beer drinkers can't go wrong with their Best Blonde lager. But they also have plenty of seasonals, and a couple of other brews from locals like Troegs and St. Benjamin's Brewing.\n\nFor food I've ordered right on apps, but had some mishaps on entrees. On my first visit I was craving the grilled cheese and tomato soup combo that was mentioned as a special, but soon regretted it after I was presented with not very grilled plain mozzarella cheese on a roll alongside some soup that was just decent. Things were slightly better with the chicken schnitzel sandwich with its delicious mulled apple honey butter spread, but just missed its mark on dry chicken. Apps have led me to some solid revelations however, especially with their incredible cheese boards, and their amazing buttermilk persimmons which might just be the best gluten free vegetarian alternative to fried chicken ever!\n\nAdd in options like a Cubano sandwich with sweet hot pickles, duck & roasted fig cavatappi, and coffee rubbed beer braised short ribs and I'm sure to find that better entree yet.

I have been going to Safeway Foods for years and unfortunately, just like anything that gets old, a refresh is going to be necessary at some point in time.  Safeway Foods is a place in need of a do over. \n\nWhat I like about Safeway Foods?  I have found some unique items at Safeway Foods.   They are a bit pricey on their produce that is not organic so I recommend skipping the produce section unless you are in dire straights and do not feel like heading to the other grocery stores in the area.  \n\nThe cashiers are always nice that I have encountered and since there is no self-checkout lanes, you do get the opportunity to have a live person help you check out.   I personally prefer having a real live cashier any day of the week.   There is also ample parking for the small customer base that Safeway Foods gets.   They do have a decent dairy section as well as general staples so you should be able to find the everyday basics.  \n\nIf you just need some basic items and want to avoid the huge crowd that major supermarket chains typically have, Safeway Foods may be just what you need.","date":"2019-07-02 17:12:54"}

So, EXCITED!  \n\nI think the place is really cute and it appeals to adults and kids. Colorful chairs and wall art. The color of the walls were played down which is a good thing since the accessories and furnishings are so vibrant. There are 4 wall stations that serve soft yogurt. Each station gives you 3 choices of self serve yogurt. After you get your desired yogurt amount, there is a topping station with multiple choices of candy, crushed grahams crackers, boba, syrups and plenty more. You pay based on the amount of yogurt in a medium sized cup which is weighed. Yes, the amount is $$-$$$ for yogurt but I am not surprised based on the location and its moderate high end yogurt shop styling & decor. I recommend they get a variety of sizes for the yogurt cups, especially smaller sizes for the kids.\n\nThe place not only serves yogurt but also, smoothies, breakfast sandwiches, coffee and sweet treats. I was able to sample the Tahitian vanilla and Caramel macchiato. The sample size was more than I expected and was almost filling. I decided on a mixture of Tahitian vanilla and expresso. Wow, they both were so delicious.

Yum.\n\nWe also shard a pot of decent green tea and slurped some  miso soup (comes with most entrees). It was really tasty soup, and it was the right temperature! Perfect for a cold winter day.\n\nWe were happy to hear that for any entree, one can sub out the meat for tofu OR extra veggies! I ordered the Lemon Chicken, and my friend had... a tofu dish with a brown sauce. Buddha something or other. We enjoyed both dishes a lot. For less than 7 bucks you get a good sized portion of food with rice, 2 small crab rangoons, and miso soup.

Fantastic location, short walk to everything. We recently spent a few days, three nights here. The front desk staff is miserable - I run a small business, I get that it's hard to be friendly all the time, but that's literally your job for eight hours. Don't make guests feel like a burden when they ask for toilet paper or towels for their rooms that housekeeping failed to provide. \n\nBar staff is rude. No cold beer. Very slow service. Same with front desk staff. \n\nThe rooms are dirty. Filthy. Gross. We had a corner suite with water views. Toothpaste marks on the mirror, dust everywhere, you could see piles of dirt and junk between the bed and bedside table, hair in the shower, etc. Very dim lighting in the room and in the bathroom especially (you will not be applying cosmetics in the bathroom), two small stained towels for two adults, no back up toilet paper, no liner in the garbage bin (that is inconveniently located outside the bathroom, instead of one in each room). Very small, poorly cleaned, unimpressive room. Stained towels, stained bedding, stained carpets. This place was a dump.\n\nNo WiFi. No cable. Some of the outlets don't work in the room. \n\nExtremely thin walls - we could hear the conversations of the couple in the room beside us, clearly, could have easily joined in. People in the halls carrying on all night. You're not going to get much rest here. \n\nMy absolute FAVORITE part of this dump was the elevators. Oh the lovely, safe, updated elevators!!! At no time were all four working - this is a 23 floor hotel with only four elevators, and for much of our stay, only two were working, at times only one. I LOVED waiting in the lobby for more than thirty minutes to go up to my room on the 22nd floor. So much fun. And there's no bathrooms down there in the lobby - you can take stairs to the second floor bathrooms if you need them, but they're usually locked according to staff, and they were when I tried to access them after coming back to a line of almost two dozen people waiting for an elevator after we'd been out to dinner. Super convenient. Once, a group of us were stuck in the elevator and despite pressing the call button, no one picked up and no one came to assist. Two of the guys in the elevator eventually got the door pried open and we were able to exit. Super fun. When we told a guy who identified himself as maintenance he just shrugged and said he hadn't heard any complaints, the desk just said it happens and walked away back on their phones. \n\nI am extremely unhappy with the hotel, the cavalier attitude of the staff when we complained, the numerous safety issues, etc. I would NEVER recommend it and I would never go back. None in my group would. Absolutely a shame, wonderful location and you can tell that it was once a really nice place. This place was an absolute dump. We were a business group of more than two dozen, rented meeting rooms and all - we were all very unhappy with our accommodations and treatment. Our next trips to Nola, both business and professional, will be with another hotel and not this dump.","date":"2021-12-06 15:51:49"}

This was the best restaurant in Nashville in 2019 and it is definitely not that anymore.  The service was extremely spotty.  Our waitress demonstrated a COMPLETE lack of understanding of the menu.  She was unable to explain or describe any dishes to us, could make no recommendations and had to look at menu just to know what was in a dish.  She allowed two of our party of six to order a dish that they had run out of a long time before (the hostess told us they only had five to begin the night so it wasn't like the table next to us had just ordered the last one.)  They refused to accommodate a requested upcharge (not a substitution, just increase the portion size of the scallops and charge us for it).  The pork I received was extremely fatty and 30 percent waste as a result.  \n\nThe bartender is excellent - world class in fact.  The hostess and other staff were better than our waitress.

When I called to make a reservation, the hostess informed me that they do not take reservations for Sunday brunch\/Mother's Day and that I was welcome to join them for Sunday brunch buffet. Relieved and happy, mom and I show up here on Sunday (the 8th) only to be told by a hostess (and a manager?) that we did indeed need reservations. I explained that I called a few days earlier and a hostess had told me reservations were not needed at all. Thankfully, this hostess seemed to be patient and understanding--even if reluctantly--and found a table for us despite the restaurant being completely booked. \n\nOur waitress, on the other hand, was incredibly kind and attentive. The selection of food was wonderful, however I was surprised to see that the customers themselves need to cut their own meat at the meat carving station should they want meat (in this case, ham). I had only ever had brunch at places where there was a trained and skilled chef\/meat carver for the customers. Isn't it a bit dangerous to let potentially inexperienced customers handle those utensils unattended?

The eggs could've used a touch more salt or hot sauce, the filling inside was a pretty solid amount, but I'm not sure if it was from the fillings or the cheese they used on top, but there was a good amount of oil puddled underneath the omelette. The price is honestly a bit pricey in my opinion - $18 for the omelette and two pieces of toast.\n\nPotatoes - super let down. There was only one photo on Yelp from like three weeks ago and that is definitely NOT what I got in my order. The amount given was good, but it's literally just fried potatoes with a side of ketchup. They didn't seemed seasoned at all and didn't come with anything. For $5, I wasn't expecting to get what could've been frozen breakfast potatoes (they didn't seem frozen, but idk for sure). The potatoes are also what made the wait time a bit longer. I wouldn't mind the wait if the potatoes were worth it, but they were not at all. \n\nOverall: maybe I'd come back?

I am a nurse and had surgery two days ago.  I received the worst treatment I have ever had in HCA South Tampa's post anesthesia care unit.  I was left alone literally sobbing in pain for most of my time in the unit. I couldn't even keep my legs still (FLACC pain scale, anyone?) because the pain was so horrific.  The nurse offered me a pill.  I was nauseous, so I asked for something IV, and she either did not have orders or declined to give me anything, and instead called the anesthesiologist to tell him that I was refusing pain medication.  There are so many problems with this.  When a patient is in 9\/10 pain and nauseous, a pill is never an appropriate intervention.  Post Anesthesia Care Units should have standing orders for IV pain and nausea medications as part of protocol.  The anesthesiologist came back and told me that IV medication wears off quickly so to give it to me would be \"pointless,\" and that his goal was to get me up and moving to go home.  My husband had to ask him to please give me something for nausea and I would agree to take the pill.  Unfortunately, by this time my pain was so out of control that whatever he gave me had little effect.  I cried nearly the entire time I was there and NO ONE cared.  My husband could hardly find a nurse to ask to help me.  They are so obsessed with not giving opiates due to the opiate crisis that they are not treating patients' pain.  Giving a patient IV pain medication within the few hours after having an organ removed is NOT going to make anyone an addict.  I wish I had the money to pursue legal action against this hospital.  Thankfully I am doing much better now and have been off all pain medications for more than 24 hours.  No one - not the hospital, not the surgeon - has called to check on me.  For all they know I could have died but they don't care.  As a patient I'm appalled, but as a nurse I'm even more so.  Please do not have surgery at this hospital.  There has to be better care out there.","date":"2021-12-30 21:48:36"}

After being on hold for 15 minutes and being in the area, my wife decided to drive to the dealership in an attempt to facilitate our recall order.\n\nWhen she arrived at the service department, my wife was disheartened to see three male employees simply sitting down, doing nothing.\n\nIt was only at this time that she was informed that the keys \"must have just come in\" and that she'd need to return with our 2010 Camaro to complete the programming of our new keys.  This information would have been of great value if she'd been able to speak with an employee via phone in advance of her visit.\n\nAt the same time (3 days later), I was still waiting for someone in the dealerships Parts department to return my call or respond to my online parts order.\n\nMy wife and I stopped in to the dealership on Florida Avenue on 1\/31\/15 to pick up our new keys for our 2010 Camaro as well as the part for the electronic passenger seat control, which we had previously been informed would have arrived via special order.\n\nWhile our keys were in fact ready (more than a month following order) the parts clerk could not locate the part that we\/she had previously ordered.  After much effort, the parts clerk informed us that she had \"forgotten\" to order the part.\n\nShe was apologetic and offered to deliver the part to our home on Tuesday, February 3rd if someone would be home to receive, which we agreed to.\n\nMy wife spent the entire day on February 3rd awaiting delivery of the part (our home is located 2 minutes from the dealership).\n\nAs no one arrived by 4:15pm, my wife called the parts department to inquire about delivery.  It appeared as if someone had \"forgotten\" to prioritize our order, so while appreciative that the part was finally delivered, it did not arrive until almost 5pm, after a wasted day of waiting on our part.\n\nBased in great part by this dealership's complete lack of customer service, my wife and I decided to take our business elsewhere in seeking to purchase our new 2015 Corvette Stingray.\n\nWe've ordered our \"dream\" car from Stingray Chevrolet in Plant City, using our paid for 2010 Camaro as a trade and paying for the remainder of the new Corvette in cash.\n\nAdditionally, we'll also be utilizing both Gordon Chevrolet and Stingray Chevrolet for the service needs of our new vehicle, as we've enjoyed outstanding customer service at both of these dealerships.\n\nRegretfully, due to this dealerships complete lack of attention to customer service, we won't be patronizing a business located only 2 minutes from our home.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nJeff and Coleen","date":"2015-02-04 21:03:17"}

Decent size, not huge for $4.50, but it was cold like biting into tasteless salad inside a sticky, chewy tortilla. It also dripped like crazy. I brought it back so they could microwave it more but their microwave is defective and only one corner was warmed after another spin. \n\nSuggestions to Mema (if there is a Mema). \n\n#1 Use better tortillas that don't smack of rubbery bleached white flour. This is a latin neighbourhood, there just has to be better ones available. \n\n#2 Make the beans tastier, if I hadn't peeled back the tortilla from the taco shell I wouldn't have known it was there. Please don't do this by adding lard. \n\n#3 Spice it up. This is Mexican food after all, a little heat wouldn't hurt. \n\n#4 Speaking of heat, serve them warm. Putting burritos on the griddle in a foil wrap for 30secs each side should do the trick. This way it's evenly heated and it keeps the tortilla from getting that microwave goo-nasty.","date":"2010-01-03 01:53:09"}

It was expensive at $4.48 after tax for the small portion, but with the quality and freshness makes it worth it.

I don't mind when a restaurant is out of something they make in-house. That's often an indication of it being fresh. However, when a restaurant has huge electronic menu boards with changing photos and items, I can't understand why they aren't able to quickly and efficiently either have a Sold Out on it but still have it there so you know what you may want for next time or have it off the menu until available again. If it were a way for them to make more money, I know they would know how to do it. Frankly, that is management's poor customer service, not the employees. With the amount of business they are doing, there should have been more than one employee at the counter and one cooking. For counter service, it was slow to get your food. This soup took 14 minutes for my soup to be ready after paying, and there were a lot of people standing to wait for their food in a congested walkway.

Each time we visit 395 they have different beers on tap, so it's nice that they have a rotation. We're still holding out for Heretic Brewing Company to be added! We enjoy stopping in on Wednesdays for trivia night and I'm happy to see how much growth this bar has had over the last few months. It's definitely becoming a regular spot for us!","date":"2019-08-03 00:10:35"}

My wife was able to order whole wheat pasta with sauce on the side and veggies.  I had the veal parm, two large pieces of breaded veal that were tasty and tender.

We took my out of town friend visiting from PA here as the basque dining experience is so unique to this area. We first sat at the bar to order a picon. The bartender (I forget his name but he had been there for 30 some years) was awesome. He made an terrific picon and provided a suggestion how how to drink it which was much appreciated as those buggers are strong! He also shared a good deal of knowledge about the basque community here and its history. \n\nOnce we were ready to move from the bar, we took seats at one of the long family style tables. I let my friend know that he needed to prepare his stomach (I had been to another basque restaurant in town and know how much food you get) but what soon came even I was surprised by! \n\nYou start with the softest yummiest bread and butter (I could literally eat the basket myself). You're served a large carafe of table wine and also out comes the soup. Split pea soup was the soup the night we went and it was enjoyed by all. Then comes a chicken dish which reminded me of chicken cacciatore. Wait, not done yet... then out comes salad... and a bean dish... THEN all three of us ordered the lamb as our entree and out comes a massive pile of perfectly cooked lamb chops. It was awesome. Somehow we managed to clean up. \n\nGreat place to come and enjoy fantastic home style food. The quality and quantity you get for the price is unbelievable. If you come with a small group like we did, be prepare to sit with strangers but don't be shy. It's a great place to meet new people. We had a blast.","date":"2019-06-20 03:30:23"}

But despite that I'm also first to admit that even though they're still laden with a plentiful number of imperfections, When Starr creates a winner he does it big time! And even though I was initially hesitant to envision it working out in Fishtown, I do have to admit that he delivered in a big way with Frankford Hall.\n\nMuch like the case is with El Rey for Mexican food; If you're looking for an authentic German beer hall do not, I repeat DO NOT come here. Go to Brauhaus Schmitz or Bierstube and do not pass go! But if you're looking to enjoy traditional German eats and steins of beer while playing games like foosball, Jenga, and then some; then Frankford may be that warehouse of possibility for you. Even better is the fact that you can do it either inside or out thanks to its HUGE interior, and courtyard that is loaded with plenty of tables and standing room (and heating lamps for when the weather gets colder).\n\nFor food I was initially confused by the ordering at the counter food court style and waiting for the food with a number. But such confusions were eliminated when I found the servers to be capable of seeking that number out like a bullseye. while bratwurst, spaetzle, amazing sounding burgers and other such delicacies were mighty tempting, I decided to go with a Bavarian pretzel w\/ cheese dip (AKA the new crack) and a refreshing bowl of escarole soup. The soup was just the right cup of warmth that the doctor ordered and had tiny meatballs in it for a bonus. And for the small the pretzel was rather huge, and was one of the better soft pretzels that I've ever had.\n\nThe Beergarden was fully loaded with Franziskanar, Spaten, Paulaner, and other German brews by the 1\/2 or whole liter. and there was plenty of other craft brews on tap and in bottles to compliment the selection beautifully. there's also one tap geared to a rotating draft that usually leads to something special. In my case it was a Dogfish Head brew that I've only seen there thus far (and you best believe I've looked!)\n\nAs a Starr spot its destined to be a place that I won't be going to all the time (we're kind of like Seinfeld and Newman - http:\/\/youtu.be\/98dai6CC5BA).

We had the hummus and eggs platter and the Le Chef egg white omelette with black beans, hummus and cauliflower. The omelette was superb and the potatoes were addictive -- especially with an extra side of spicy Lebanese sausage (great with the hummus and foul).

Where should we go?\"\n\nAnyway, the mix here is actually pretty good - both music and people. Everyone is also here to dance, which is great. \n\nMy only problem with the music is that three, four, even five times a night, this will happen:\n\nGo shawty, it's your birthday, we goin' party like it's your birthday, we goin' sip Bacardi like it's your birthday, and we DON'T STOP BELIEVIN'! HOLD ON TO THAT FEEEELIN'!\n\nTo sum up my sentiment on exactly how that works, I have to say that even though Mad River attracts a fairly diverse crowd, it's runner-up for my \"Whitest Club u Kno in Philadelphia\" award. First place is Plough and the Stars, but we'll save that for another review. \n\nLet me be clear that I have no problem with this, and neither does anyone else in Mad River. We can dig it, Mad River DJ. We just want you to soften up those transitions a little more. \n\nBecause when the white people music comes on, me, and every other minority in Mad River has to stop for a few seconds to scratch our heads.\n\nIt's all good, though, because by the chorus of any of these songs (\"Pour Some Sugar on Me,\" \"Don't Stop Believin',\" \"Livin' on a Prayer,\" \"Sweet Caroline,\" etc), we're probably singing along with all the white oppressors.\n\nYou've won this time, whitey!\n\nNow for my one (BIG) negative: \n\nBachelorette parties - I still believe that there are some bachelorette parties out there that get crazy and are tons of fun. But THOSE bachelorette parties don't go to Mad River. The ones that come here are the anti-fun of the universe. You know, the kind that stand around, aren't drunk, and are in their little bubble judging everyone.\n\nSpecifically, the kind that has gotten my friends kicked out of the club for \"causing trouble.\" Or, as normal people might say, \"talking to them.\"\n\nMy condolences to the husbands.\n\nWhich leads me to my pro-tip: Don't come here anywhere around wedding season. It's not pretty.\n\nPS\nOne of these days I'm actually going to eat here, just to see what it's like.","date":"2010-12-22 17:31:53"}

I like it.\n\nI've been to a lot of late nights here lately because White Dog closes before 11, and New Deck and Mad Mex are always way too full. I had kind of held off on trying the place for a while because I'd seen it get middling reviews, but I can safely say I'm a fan.\n\nEverything I've had here so far has been pretty tasty - the fish tacos, crab cake sandwiches, salads, lobster bisque, the lobster roll, and of course, the oysters. So, food is a win. So is drink, on the most part - they've got a respectable beer, liquor, and wine selection, so you can't really go wrong.\n\nWhere this place really shined for me was the service, and the crazy late night happy hour. Small plates (creatively termed - they're kinda large) of various selections for 5 bucks each, and then the dollar oysters and the beer and drink specials. You can get hammered and stuffed a the same time for 20-30 bucks. Who can argue with that on a Thursday night? Not I, my friend, not I.\n\nSo, if you don't like seafood, I suppose this place would be out of consideration. If you do, definitely check it out.","date":"2014-05-05 20:23:48"}

The only thing that has improved; they are now once again issuing standard eating utensils, and instead of shouting out your name, they give you a number that's placed at the end of your table. What hasn't changed; still no extra napkins without begging for them, still no artificial sweetener without begging for it, still no salt and pepper without begging for it. I asked the \"manager\" about that, and she said \"I can't do it\". Now let me explain why this makes no business sense. We ordered iced tea with lemon (by the way, I also asked for extra artificial sweetener, since I already saw there was none on the tables. I was given two packets of Splenda, and there was no ice in my tea). We were told they had no lemon at the beverage station. I would have to go up to the bar and get some. When I went up to the bar to get some lemon slices, the bartender dropped the rag out of his ungloved hand, reached into a bin, and pulled out a couple of lemon slices. At the beverage station, they have a dozen or so uncovered plastic cups of ice water. So, they can't leave salt and pepper shakers on the table, they can't leave a stack of napkins or paper towels nearby, and they can't supply artificial sweetener, but they can expose you to anyone and everyone's germs who passes by the beverage station with the uncovered cups of ice water, and it's okay for their employees to reach for lemon with their bare hand? What's wrong with this picture?!? Does anyone else see the hypocrisy in this?\nNow to the food. Very disappointing today. I ordered the pulled pork shoulder tray. I requested Alabama White Sauce (2). It  arrived with one vinegar-based sauce. The pork was dried out, and had quite a few large, hard, black, charred pieces in it. I don't know this for sure, but we were there shortly after they opened, and I'm going to guess it was left over from the day before. \nI said with my last review I would not be back.

Even though, I dine at Chava's around the corner and a friend lives down the street - it would have never dawned on me to give this place a try. This space has been so many things, that have come and gone, that I have stopped taking notice. I hope this one makes it and stays.\n\nSince it was my first visit, I went with Ian's Must Order. I enjoyed a, Foulard Primer. It's hot, hand cut hickory & mulberry smoked prime-rib. The meat was super tender and served with a bone-marrow aioli spread. It was also topped with charred onion, arugula and blue cheese cream - all served on a french roll. This sandwich could of been two meals, but I managed to eat it all in one sitting. I couldn't help myself, it was surprisingly that good. \n\nAll sandwiches come with one side and I couldn't resist ordering the Mac-n-Cheese. They use a cork screw pasta and a three cheese sauce. This one side was large enough for two to share. However eating alone, I managed to eat it all.  In my defense it was a late lunch and ended up being my only meal of the day. \n\nThe space is compact and very crowded. If you're dining at peak time, you'll be sharing a table and making new friends.

But that's also what makes it kind of weird, because it feels like you're patronizing three businesses in the space of like 800 square feet. So as somebody with introversion and generalized anxiety, it kind of keeps me on edge that rules and boundaries and stuff are not clearly delineated. But I don't think that bothers 90% of the clientele, so you're probably good. I've been here maybe six times in the past couple of years, always on a weekend night as far as I can remember, so it's busy and crowded, but not uncomfortably so like, say, Congress. Like, I'm not forced to touch other people all the time. So I do like that it's solidly staying in business but not overrun by patrons. It also attracts a slightly older crowd, and I like that, because I am technically Young by literal age standards (30), but I also am not trying to potentially run into my own U of A students by going to super young, ultra hip joints. It also means that they play tolerable (ie actually good!) music. I really like whoever is DJing over there. They are doing just the right amount of thinking about things and not overthinking.\n\nI like a place that gets creative with its drinks, and as someone who used to give a lot of her precious free hours to Food Network and Bravo (Top Chef, not anything else on that channel), I've always been really curious about molecular gastronomy. So hooray! HighWire does that. But then I tried it and now I get why all the judges on food shows are like, ENOUGH ALREADY WITH THE MOLECULAR STUFF; WE DON'T NEED YOU TO BE ON A ONE-CHEF MISSION TO USE UP ALL THE PLANET'S LIQUID NITROGEN; YOU ARE NOT AS COOL AS YOU THINK YOU ARE. It's really all for show and not for the actual product\/taste\/mouthfeel. \"Vodka caviar\" sure sounds fun; it also tastes exactly like it sounds, which is to say it's like boba balls of straight alcohol, to the point that it feels like it may be isopropyl alcohol than stuff that is actually comestible. Cool stuff, bro, but I don't actually want to consume it. I let my friend taste some of mine and she knocked a good half of it over and onto the floor and there were still too many for me to handle. What do you do with them? Snack on one in between sips? Break them open with your teeth and let them sink into your drink? I don't know, and I'm not convinced the bar staff knows either.\n\ntl;dr come for the atmosphere so long as you are not anxious about unclear structures\/rules, but be prepared for a little pretentious a bar menu.","date":"2019-01-03 19:37:44"}

On my tour I met a couple that traveled with Gate 1 for over 25 tours! I was impressed!\n\nI did the 8 day essential Greece and purchased it during a flash sale. It was deeply discounted at about $799 per person. The tour was so popular that they even included the optional excursion of the Greek cooking class (which was fun and delicious). My group was approximately 40 people and the age group was about mid 20s to mid 70s.\n\nUpon arrival at the airport I was met by Stella who was very friendly and handed me my packet of info of everything I needed to know about my tour (including my pick up time for the airport on my departure day). It was all very organized. Later that night I met Evgenia who we called Jenny. Jenny was our tour guide the rest of the trip and I was impressed that she was an actual archaeologist that excavated Santorini before becoming a tour guide. In Greece, all tour guides are trained for three years and so she was not only our tour manager but also our local tour guide everywhere. It was awesome. She knew so much!\n\nWhile in Athens we stayed at a hotel that was within walking distance to the Acropolis and the Plaka area.  In my opinion, Plaka in Athens has the best shopping out of all the cities we visited and the shop owners are nice. The restaurants in the Plaka area are also very affordable even though this area is popular. I was able to buy a gyro at a fast food shop for 2.40 euro! God's Restaurant was also very good and affordable (get the pancake w\/mushroom sauce appetizer--I'm not sure if it on the menu but it was recommended by the table sitting next to us). The restaurant at our hotel (Athenian Carllirhoe hotel) was also very good. A dish of mussels for 10 euro! The tour also included a trip on the metro train. The metro is so easy to use in Athens!\n\nThere is a good amount of walking on this tour. There are cobble stones and unpaved areas where the ruins are. Places can also be hilly. You can opt to go explore with the group or stay behind near the bus if walking long distances or on rough terrain isn't what you enjoy. Jenny showed us a lot of areas of Athens and Gate 1 treated us to baklava and Greek coffee as well as candies and ouzo (Greek alcohol).\n\nThe hotels we stayed at were great. All had wifi and free hot buffet breakfast. I went to Greece end Nov\/early Dec so the rooms were a bit warm because what Greeks think is cold is not actually that cold for Americans. They didnt have AC in the rooms because it was winter. Thankfully the windows opened to let in the cold air.\n\nI didn't purchase any optional tours before the tour started. I was able to add the optional tours later but the Acropolis Walking tour required payment in Euros (which thankfully I had!) and not credit cards. Thankfully I was able to pay with credit card for the optional full day cruise to Hydra.\n\nStella (instead of Jenny) was with us the entire full day cruise in case we had any issues on the cruise.  The cruise offered a buffet lunch and it was really good.  It stopped off at three islands (Hydra, Poros, and Aegina.) At Aegina they offered a bus tour of either classical (27 euro) or panoramic (23 euro).  I think the tours were offered because during the time we were there it was siesta. You purchased the ticket on the boat with the cruise line and you can pay via credit card. I did the panoramic tour and I was not impressed. The windows on the bus were foggy so I couldn't get any good pictures. Aegina is also the island where the pistachio trees are and where many vendors sell pistachio products so buy pistachio stuff here not in Athens. The cruise boat served coffee\/water\/snacks for a fee and the seating was very comfortable. The boat allows for 800 passengers. Thankfully it was not a busy day when we went so we could spread out. The bathrooms on that boat were also clean and easy to use. The staff was friendly and offered a dancing show with free dancing lessons. I'm glad I did this optional tour.\n\nAs I've gotten older I've gotten more prone to motion sickness. We were told if the weather was bad then the boat cruise would be cancelled. Thankfully the weather wasn't bad on the day of our departure but the rocking of the boat still had my stomach feeling queasy. I was able to reposition myself in a way so I was rocking backward and forward instead of sideways which helped a lot. I never got motion sickness on the bus because our bus driver was awesome.\n\nGreece is the best country in the E.U because the people are friendly, the food is delicious and cheap, the souvenirs are so affordable and the history\/stories behind the ruins is so magical. You don't have to pay to use the W.C (water closet aka bathroom) at any of the places. The only downside is that you might have to pay in Euros because some restaurants don't take credit cards but you can get Euros from any of the ATMs here. I highly recommend this tour to Greece with Gate 1!","date":"2017-12-18 21:42:14"}

So sad to miss DiNic's though, I will have to return at some point. Thanks to Bobby P, Andrew T and Mira V for the suggestion.","date":"2010-04-17 19:02:19"}

The bartender served us waters and beer. We got through most of our meal and then my friend noticed that there was a very large shard of glass in her water glass.

The bartender was somewhat apologetic and comped the bill, but this incident stuck with me as we were worried my friend may have ingested a smaller piece of glass or that other people had done the same.

Check!\n\nDelicious drinks? Check!\n\nVedge? Amazing!!!\n\nI went here on a random Thursday when we were looking to try out the new vegan restaurant that the Horizon's owners had put together.  I was originally trying to find a reservation for three on a Tuesday, and found that there was NOTHING available, which was a sign that we were definitely in for a good meal.  The interior is gorgeous and huge. I didn't expect the restaurant to be as big as it is, and it's warm and inviting inside.  The space seems apt for veg friendly food, as it has clean, white touches and beautiful wood floors.  We were seated as soon as our party arrived, and we began our food \/ drink journey of awesomeness.  \n\nWe began with the purple carrots and crispy cauliflower from the dirt list as apps, they were both delicious.  The carrots were cooked and served with black eyed peas, and the cauliflower is amazing. I mean beyond amazing. The sauce they were served in was SO GOOD! I salivate as I am writing this in fact, as the thought and words describing it make me want it now.  \n\nWe continued to order the gojuchang tofu, the the grilled seitan, and the golden beets.  The beets were amazing, and fresh, and delicious. The dill that was served on the side was GREAT.  The gojuchang tofu has a great spice to it, and the grilled seitan comes with wonderful lentils.  The food was all just amazing, and every bite was satisfying.  There is flavor, freshness, and nothing is so heavy that you feel gross, but everything fills you up! \n\nTo finish, we ordered the three ice creams and the chocolate pot.  The ice cream flavors we tried were popcorn (tasted like candy popcorn), root beer, and stout.  Each one was amazing, and creamy, and great.  The chocolate pot was our second dessert, and equally awesome. In fact we mixed some of the ice creams with the chocolate for a great taste. \n\nFinally, the drink list is interesting, but I stuck with beer.  My dinner companions weren't too sure of anything on the menu, and instead told the bartender \/ waitress what they liked, and the bartender made them drinks to order. They were GREAT. The bartender came out to see us at one point, and he's genius \/ friendly.  \n\nService was great, ambiance was great, food was great. I really can't say enough about vedge.

My husband and I typically order takeout at the minimum, once a week and the food is always wonderful (no complaints there), a few mistakes in the past but nothing worth noting. We ordered take out on 04-Sept for lunch and we should have known an issue would transpire when the young gentlemen told us on the phone he is new and was struggling to take our 4 item order. We picked up the food shortly thereafter and when we got home we noticed what we originally ordered and was charged (Shrimp Tempura Supreme I - $14.00) was not included; in place of it was Shrimp Tempura ($6.00 list price per the menu). I was perfectly fine with the deviation of my order; however, I wanted the $8.00 difference in price refunded. At that point, I called back to tell them of the error and the young gentlemen who originally took my order picked up the phone, in which I summarized the issue. He told me he can't do anything about it right now, and I will have to wait for a manager to call me back to issue a void on my credit card, so I left my name and contact information. Two days passed and no call back and no void on my card. I then called again to which the young lady who answered told me she needs a manager to handle this situation; to which again, I summarized the issue and stated that I have indeed been waiting for a manager to call me back. To no avail, I called again this afternoon, to which I received the same answer...a manager needs to handle this. At this point I'm becoming increasingly frustrated with the young staff that don't appear to be understanding my frustration. I decided to drive to Omiza this evening (08-Sept) to speak directly to 'anyone' at this point, who can help me get my $8.00 refunded. I approached the young woman at the counter and explained who I was and how I've now left 3 different messages across 3 different days, to which no one will assist me. Her response was quite shocking, \"The manager is managing 3 different restaurants, and you need to realize that.\" To my shock, she was EXTREMELY arrogant, obnoxious, and exceedingly condescending. She told me that a manager can only do refunds. I question this policy simply by stating, \"If I were to order food at this moment, and you incorrectly ring me up, would you refund my credit card?\" She simply stated \"Yes, of course,\" to which I simply asked her if she sees the irony and asinine logic in the situation. At this point, all of the young staff (servers, and hostesses decided to crowd around her like a mob) are glaring at me as if I am trying to get one over on Omiza (I simply want my $8.00 which was Omiza's error in the first place). A server told me if I order food, they'll credit me next time, to which I declined and simply again stated, \"I just want my money at this point.\" She decided to leverage the awkward silence and stare maneuver, as if she couldn't do anything more at this point. I told her I want my refund, period, and I'm happy to wait while she calls a manager, any manager at this point (I suggested refund the $14.00 and charge me $6.00, I don't care how you do it, but I want my $8.00). At that point she said she had to call her manager. Now the young staff are all talking in a circle behind the counter as if I'm not standing right there (again, extremely unprofessional, patronizing, obnoxious, and arrogant). She hovers over the phone without picking up the handset, and at this point an older woman appears from the kitchen and just tells her to give me the $8.00 out of the register...finally, some relief (thank you to whoever you are!). Surprising that a restaurant of Omiza's caliber would employ such young, arrogant, and obnoxious front desk staff. You would think I was trying to steal $8.00 from the pockets of the hostess\/young lady at the counter. I've never felt a more condescending attitude from a restaurant than today. Again, I am truly shocked Omiza is OK with how their restaurant is apparently being run in the absence of management (apparently by obnoxious children, because that is how they act), and by default the face of Omiza when you call or walk in. (Remember, all 3 instances across 3 different days from early afternoon until evening, when I called, the front counter stated a manager was not there).\n\nAlso, I have a picture of the receipt and food to prove a point if I get questioned.\n\nYours truly, a former loyal customer.","date":"2021-09-09 00:38:55"}

And for this first visit, my greet tea Frappuccino is as delicious as any that I have gotten before at other Starbucks.\n\nSo let's talk about what is unique about this particular Starbucks location.\n\nStarbucks moved to this much more spacious location, formerly a nice Cosi, from the smaller one it had across the street at 1201 Walnut. Starbucks leveled the entire floor, from the step-up dining area that the former Cosi had. This is a great location within Philadelphia's bustling \"Gayborhood\", through which a lot of customers funnel throughout the day.\n\nThere is plenty of space to move around within the restaurant, which actually is the one big fault I have of it. There is not an ample amount of seating here, especially when you take the cavernous size of available space here into consideration. Starbucks could easily seat many more people, if it bought more tables & chairs to reconfigure a denser dining area. I was here just before the dinner hour on a Sunday, and I was lucky someone moved so I could have a seat.\n\nThe restroom area is sizable, and interesting that each restroom does not have sinks inside them - the hand-washing sink area is on the outside of each restroom. It's a pretty cool setup, until you consider that you will be touching other people's urine and feces on the door handle when you exit the room. Having the sinks on the outside of the restroom is fine, if you have door-less walk-in restrooms (which this location does not have). So there's that.\n\nThere doesn't seem to be any outdoor seating, and the weather has been nice for the past few weeks that this location has been open. Cosi used to have to deal with a lot of less desirable types of people lingering with its outdoor seating; perhaps Starbucks just doesn't want to deal with that element at all, by forgoing outdoor tables and chairs?\n\nOtherwise, Starbucks should be applauded for moving to this larger location. It should allow greater amounts of people to get in and out quicker.","date":"2019-10-28 00:19:42"}

Then it was as if she were required to solve a calculus equation before she were able to seat us in the nearly empty restaurant-she seemed befuddled. \n\nOnce seated, we waited, for a loooong while. While we waited, a couple of servers waited on their respective tables, but wouldn't dare make eye contact or answer my calls for assistance. Only once I went to the hostess and told her to get someone to our table did a server appear. We had our server take our drink and food order since we had had plenty of time to make our decisions. \n\nOur drinks were brought out and as other customers filtered in, we watched as the other servers brought their tables complimentary nacho chips with their drinks. Fortunately, one of the other servers asked if we were doing okay and I suggested we would like some chips while we waited or our food, to which she acted surprised we had not been offered. Then we also noticed the other customers had been provided linen napkins with their utensils while we had paper napkins (not a big deal on any other day, but by this time every little thing felt like a slight). \n\nWhen our food arrived, mine came with a side other than what I had requested. I pointed this out to our server and she said she would be right back. Well, the side I had originally requested (macaroni and cheese) arrived by the time I had finished my sandwich, so I guess her idea of \"right back\" is a bit different than mine. The food was mediocre at best.\n\nThen, we had completed our meal and waited about 10 minutes or longer before our server reappeared. No check-in from her during our meal, just a visit after a rather extended period of time after dropping off my corrected side dish. We immediately asked for our check right away before we were delayed any longer and had a chance to become more angry. \n\nI do not recommend this restaurant and am disappointed this relatively new establishment will probably not survive long if their service and food does not markedly improve.","date":"2017-02-20 01:06:12"}

I am totally understanding of changes to a completion estimate, it happens. My repairs were at a standstill for a back-ordered part. When asked, they had no idea when it would arrive. All it took was a 10 minute call from my adjuster; he found the part IN STOCK at a local dealer, as well as at least one other source The parts department at Jim Browne clearly failed to even make the effort to get the part. I am NOT forgiving of poor communications. They were to make status calls twice a week, which is right in their paperwork. They never did so until it was brought to the managers attention the poor job that was being done. Every time I had to call for any information, but more than 1\/2 the times, the call was not returned and I had the call again or ended up having to drive to the shop just to know how my repairs were coming. In the recoating of a damaged wheel someone failed to even notice the poor work. It was clear as day the second I saw it. So my adjuster agreed to my refusal and approved a new wheel. The wheel was delivered, yet they were unable to complete it in an afternoon. Was told the next morning, still not done. So to mount and balance a tire has taken over 10 actual hours but it is still not done. Given their poor communications, I called to see if the vehicle was done. Yes, the receptionist claimed.

The owner and cook is very kind, and everyone who comes in there are practically regulars because she stops to talk to them. They also all know each other by name.

I was already en route to the restaurant, so I arrived maybe around 8:20pm. When I got there, there were two people waiting for orders to go, and there was a table of four already seated. There were two employees there. The cook (owner) and a waitress. The waitress was taking the money from one customers to go order and I was next in line. When it was my turn to pay, she said she would be right with me. She then went to go take the order for the table of four that was seated. No biggie, since I knew my order probably wasn't ready yet. After I paid, I sat and waited. While I waited, the two others who were before me received their orders and left. There were also two other people who came in while I waited, and received their to go order. AND the table of four received all of their food while I waited! Now remember, they had just placed their order while I was standing in line to pay. At this point my order was already placed almost 30 minutes prior. While I waited, the owner gave me a Thai Tea and said it was on her and she appreciated my patience. She mentioned that she had a call off. However, I feel as though the orders should have been made in the order they were placed. Especially since I called and was already there waiting. Finally my order was ready around 9:15pm. This was 15 minutes after closing.\n\nThis most recent experience put a bad taste in my mouth regarding this restaurant.

For one, they are STARTLINGLY small. It appears as though they took a standard room and cut it in half. The depth is normal, the width is not. It's genuinely difficult to maneuver between the bed & the dresser with the TV on it due to how narrow the room is. The bed itself was nice, big and soft, but was also covered with what appeared to be tiny pieces of styrofoam? They were circular, about the size of the head of a pin, and the same color as the bedding, so it was impossible to see until my significant other and I woke up COVERED in them. \n\nSpeaking of waking up- we were jolted awake very early by what sounded like construction of some kind? It was an EXTREMELY loud buzzing\/vibrating that I took for a chainsaw or hedgeclipper, but as we saw nothing outside, my SO suggested maybe it was some kind of pump issue above us? Whatever the case, I wear earplugs, so it's hard to wake me up unless it's something VERY disturbing, which this was. Our #1 itinerary for the day had been to sleep in, which was unfortunately shot to hell. \n\nThere were also some issues with the restroom...it was tiny, the door was very tough to close, and there was a lingering...odor. I ran the fan and tried to air it out, but there was a distinct, underlying \"outhouse\" smell that made it difficult for me to even stomach being in there for the ~10 mins each day that it took to shower.  \n\nBasically, I would recommend this hotel if money is NO object. If you can upgrade to a larger room, get an ocean view, pay the exorbitant prices for good food\/spa treatment\/beach equipment, you should! But if you're trying to be at all frugal, skip this place and get a Holiday Inn or somewhere that is just a room, at a reasonable price, and explore St. Pete's that way. \n\nI'm still leaving this review as an above-average because there were nice aspects (like the bathrobes!

We arrived around 10am and were seated immediately - which is great because Sabrina's is typically packed with a wait. So we sat, and sat, and sat. Maybe 15 minutes had passed and not one single person acknowledged us. I understand that a lot of businesses are short-staffed, but as I looked around at the not-so-busy restaurant, I began to get frustrated. I would've settled for \"someone will be right with you\" ... something! I told hubby we would give them 5 more minutes before we left. Well, this lady was sat at the table behind us, and she was greeted IMMEDIATELY! At this point I was done, so we grabbed our things and we left. The woman who was working the front and who sat us, cheerfully said \"bye, have a nice day\" as if she didn't just see us walk in. Wouldn't you have wondered why we were leaving so abruptly??? Hubby caught the manager on the way out and expressed our disappointment. He (the manager) apologized and asked us if we wanted to sit back down, and we politely declined. We're now dining at Minella's - which is crowded and we've already been seated & served! \n\nP.S. Sabrina's is BYOB - I bought 2 bottles of champagne (not for nothing), but I'm annoyed nonetheless.

As far as the service I felt as if every other table was getting checked on periodically except our table. We were the only minorities in the restaurant so not sure if it had to do with that or not. We had to flag down our waitress for everything. Our water was empty for 15 minutes, my friends wanted another drink but by the time the waitress actually came to our table she didn't even want one anymore. Our waitress literally would check on the tables across from us every five minutes and walk directly past ours not even looking our way. We watched her do this several times and finally had to wave to get her attention. \n\nAs far as food it was a limited menu, and despite being hungry I barely ate - the food was not good at all. We ordered buffalo chicken dip which was literally huge chunks of chicken way to big to even put on a chip. I also got the impossible burger and literally I have had plenty of those and I am pretty sure it was not an impossible burger, more tasted like a regular veggie burger. So the only thing I ate was the fries.

On face value, this image holds up. Overall the facility is clean, and the MAJORITY of the staff treats the pets like their own. However, in the time I have worked there, I have grown all too aware of the selfishness and greed that allows this company to prosper, all thanks to owner Will's prioritization of money over quality of care.\n\nSome of what goes on behind the scenes both makes me uncomfortable as an employee and sorry for our customers and their pets, because when it comes to an extra penny here or there, honesty and quality of care are sacrificed. This is especially the case during holidays\/travel seasons, when the owner deliberately overbooks the facility, meaning more pets are in the facility than there are dens to hold them. Your pet may be spending their stay in a small drying den meant for temporarily holding bath dogs, yet you will pick them up believing that your money was going towards your pet staying in one of the actual, full size dens with an indoor and outdoor area.\n\nWorse yet, if your dog is booked for the more expensive Deluxe Suites, it is very likely that they will not be in here at all, but that instead your pet spent their time in the standard kennel or one of the smaller drying dens I mentioned, never to be refunded or even notified. Deluxe suites only holds 4 dogs, but again Will overbooks to the extreme.\n\nI have seen him go as far as 9 dogs over holding capacity.  \n\nThe owner goes out of his way to cover this up and puts staff in the uncomfortable situation of deceiving customers. This ranges from \"walk their dog around the  outside of the building so it looks like they are coming from the direction of deluxe suites\" and \"move their dog out into a real den in case the owners ask to come back.\"\n\nBusy holidays are not the safest time for your pet to board, which is incidentally when most people need to board. Cleaning is often forgone and mistakes are made due to lack of staff, such as dens left dirty with old water because of how quickly dogs are being shuffled in and out.\n\nI strongly advise that you board your pet here with caution, and look into other options.","date":"2020-03-24 02:51:26"}

I LOVE that they serve Hemingway Daiquiri and although the first iteration was a little bit of a bust the other two were quite nice.  My friend also had a first drink (something with orange bitters) that was just meh but switched over to another and enjoyed that.  \n\nWe ordered the pork belly appetizer even though it wasn't part of the very affordable appetizer list.  I will admit that I don't know really what pork belly is.  I always think of it as fattier bacon.  What we got was like fat with bacon.  It is entirely possible that is what it was supposed to be.  We were able to cut and navigate around it and enjoy the yummy red beans that accompanied it but it was a little off putting at first.\n\nWe ate at the bar so we had the opportunity to interact with the bar staff and they are \"kicks\".

No matter what time it is, there is a long a$$ line!! Now I know why!!! This is my favorited pizza in Nashville, hands down!\n\nThey have a parking lot next to and behind the building. You walk up and get in line. You become friends with the people in line because everyone is so happy and friendly. The people who own the place and work there come out and offer pizza samples and answer questions about the menu while you wait. They hand out laminated menus for you to peruse. Once you walk in, there is a bar past the pizza line that you can order some local brews and wine while you stand in the short line to order pizza. The anticipation is so KILLER!!! So many smiles everywhere. The vibe in so infectious. EVERYONE working there has swagger because they love what they are doing. \n\nNow, for the food. We ordered the Smokin' Herb pizza with smoked chicken and added bacon. You know what was not added? Cost. Their flat prices encompass as many toppings as you want for a pizza. Just be careful of how many you add because it may compromise the crispiness of the crust. All these ingredients are so fresh and local. The other pizza we made up with spicy red sauce as the base. Once you are finished ordering, the pizzas are passed through an oven Quizno's style. You are handed tokens and you bring the tokens to the bar where you pay and purchase more delicious beverages. There is a cooler with non-alcoholic options (FANTA in so many flavors!!!) next to the bar. Then you go to the front and pick out 1 or 6 different drizzles. The jalapeno ranch was good enough to drink!! \n\nWe grabbed a seat at one of the family style tables with round suspended stools that are so comfy and space saving. We loved what they did with the space. Old episodes of Fresh Prince of Bel-Air projected onto the wall. Quotes from 90's movies with 90's jams blasting on the sound system. Chatted with the people that are veterans and their love for the place was apparent. Again, they were so happy. They call out our number and we gladly grabbed our pizzas. We could not believe how delicious, fresh, and different this place and pizza was. One of the staff walked around to make sure everything was delicious. Great customer service from beginning to end. We cannot wait to come back! \n\nLastly, if you could not tell, I loved how happy the place was and could not get over the community feel that was in the air. It was nice to see diversity. I felt at home. I have been looking for years to feel this way in Nashville. This is the first place that has done this for me. I love the back story about the owners and how they chose where they were going to put this place. They are giving back to the community that made them who they are. Beautiful. They have blown it out of the water. It was so refreshing to come to place that was not pretentious and cares about every aspect of your experience. Amidst all the farm to table, stuffy, expensive places that are opening, this is a breath of affordable yet delicious fresh air. Thank you, Slim & Husky's!","date":"2017-07-02 17:02:34"}

The adorable shop dog hung around all cute and happy while Lloyd and I did our shopping. And then came the cat. \n\nThe woman behind the counter had an alarmed look on her face when I announced that I had seen the cat. I immediately told her that though I don't anticipate and issues, I don't know how Lloyd is with cats because he has never met one in his time with us. She immediately looked a little nervous and said that the cat \"isn't always great with dogs\".  \n\nUmmmm.  Is it just me, or am I in a dog shop?  Why on Earth would you have an animal loose in a dog store who doesn't get along with dogs?\n\nLloyd froze and stared at the cat (cause he's a wimp and that's what he does when he's scared). The cat's back curled up, it hissed, and it charged at Lloyd. I got between the bully cat and Lloyd and we were both very upset with the interaction. My heart was pounding and Lloyd was definitely distressed. I do not know what would have happened had I not put myself between Lloyd and the cat, but I do now know that the cat has a history of attacking dogs and that the owner is in no way accepting responsibility for this, nor is she doing anything to protect the animals who come into the shop.\n\nWe bought our toy, said goodbye to the cute shop dog and went on our way thinking that this must have been an isolated incident. But I couldn't stop thinking about it because I was so upset and when I got home I decided to look through the reviews to see if anyone else has had similar experiences, only to find out that the cat attacked a dog in the shop 4 weeks ago.\n\nThis cat attacked a dog a month ago and is still in the shop. \n\nA few weeks later, it hissed and charged my dog. \n\nThe cat is still in the shop and the owner wrote me a message today basically saying not to come back if I don't like it.  Cool, Noe, I definitely won't, but I will also not be quiet and not try to warn other customers that they are endangering their pets by walking in to your store. \n\nThis is not ok. How many dogs need to get hurt before they take the steps to ensure the safety of the customers and their animals? While I understand based on the shop's response to the injured dog's mom that the cat is a rescue and is working on issues - my little Lloyd is a shelter dog, too - it's not unreasonable to assume that dog boutiques are safe for dogs. You shouldn't worry that there is an animal with a history of violence lurking behind the food aisle.\n\nHad I read the other review before I went shopping, I never would have stopped in. Luckily Lloyd wasn't hurt, but the cat is bigger than Lloyd and could have caused seriously injury.  Hopefully this will reach more people and we are able to prevent future incidents, or better yet, that the shop removes the combative cat and allows everyone to have a positive and safe shopping experience. Based on her quick and nasty response to both me and the other customer whose dog was attacked, I would say that is not going to happen. \n\nLloyd is NOT the only dog who was put in danger by simply entering BONeJOUR.  You and your animals will also be at risk and Noe is placing the value of having the cat in the shop over the value of the safety of our pets.  Again, this is not OK.  Enter at your own risk, but I certainly don't recommend it.","date":"2017-04-02 23:22:33"}

Not bad. \n\nI also met the owner, Willie, at the end of the night and he was very nice also! \n\nThe crowd was a mix... groups of 3-4 friends. Plenty of space at the bar. People in their 20's mostly. Decent  amount of dancing space. \n\nSeriously, you guys should just come here one night for shits and giggles! You will surprisingly have way more fun than you would have imagined!","date":"2014-05-18 17:22:44"}

On my way back from a trip, I was looking for a good brunch spot and remembered this place. Thought I'd try it again and see if it was as good as I remembered.\n\nIt absolutely was! Since having new dietary needs, (no carbs and no sugar), sometimes it's kind of dicey to find delicious food that's still fresh & healthy. The server was great at suggestions. I had the Cali: scrambled eggs, chargrilled chicken, bacon, Swiss cheese and guacamole. I Substituted the potatoes for a bed of kale. The chicken was seasoned great and not overcooked. Delicious!\n\nMy friend had the big hungry breakfast.... See pics. The pancakes were delightful, soft and fluffy on the inside and crunchy on the outside. I wasn't a fan of the potatoes ...the seasoning was slightly off and not very tasty. He liked his dish and the overall experience was very enjoyable.\n\nBy the way, they also offer outdoor seating and a patio area that has big, beautiful trees and a person playing music (on a Sunday). Very nice, as the weather gets cooler.","date":"2019-10-16 17:54:03"}

With rave Yelp reviews, it was on the Yelp bucket list for some time.\n\nFirst, what I loved the most about the experience, is the lady behind the counter. She was extremely polite, funny and very giving.\n\nWe ordered two combos. The first, white rice with oxtail in peanut sauce, and chicken Adobe. The second, noodles with pork stew, and beef stew. The lady was kind enough to give us a small portion of another beef  curry dish to sample.\n\nWe ended the meal with halo halo dessert and 2 pieces of fried plantain.\n\nEach dish was flavorful, so I wont comment much on those. Unfortunately, there were a few things I disliked. \n\n1) The white rice was hard,and probably cooked much earlier in the day or previous day. We were there around 3pm on a Saturday.\n2) I'm used to oxtail made Caribbean or Indian style, and not in a peanut sauce. I didnt care much for this dish. To each his own, I guess. It just didnt bring the flavor of the oxtail out.\n3) Lastly, it was my first experience eating halo halo. The ice cream was absolutely delicious (tried mango and jackfruit flavors). The rest of the dessert, again I didnt care much for. Under the ice cream was some kind of ice mixture. Under that was jello cubes and a couple different types of beans. This must be a Philippino delicacy?\n\nOverall, good experience. One of the best bang for the buck places out there. So much good food for so little.","date":"2020-02-09 01:25:03"}

It is best to go with a large group to get the full experience, since everything is family style in large platters.\n\nThe food comes with a cold partially sliced loaf of terrible soda bread, and possible some olive oil on the side, depending on your server.  Never expect to review good service here or you will be very disappointed.  Plus, do not come here if you are in a rush, even for a pick-up order, because everything takes forever.\n\nI read the menu three times and looked all over the table for a drink menu and did not find one.

We were able to set up a family style meal for eight with a set price before we went with drinks a la carte.\n\nThe food was amazing. I loved everything that came out. We had brocollini and beets for our first courses. It was then on to pasta and pizza which was top notch. Next was steak and fish which weren't my favorite but were well cooked but a bit under seasoned. Lastly was dessert my favorite of which was the panna cotta like cheesecake.\n\nMy concern and why I chose to write a yelp review was that the server did something very sketchy and something I haven't seen before as a former waitress myself or in other restaurants. At the beginning of the meal I ordered a wine and where my red flag went up is when I had 1\/4 of a glass left and he refilled 1. Without asking if I'd like more and 2. It wasn't a fresh full glass of wine so I only got a 3\/4 pour. This was very strange to me but I thought maybe the other girls had gotten a bottle and he forgot which wine I got.\n\nAt the end of the night it turns out he was doing this to every lady at the table who had gotten wine. Our bill came back with 9 wines between two ladies which was very high. We complained to the server with him being rude about it. The manager ended up taking a wine or two off so while appreciated I just want the server to be trained as well. It was a very sketchy practice and while I don't personally blame the restaurant I would most likely not go back knowing this server was doing this. \n\nI have the servers name if management is interested but won't post it publicly here.","date":"2019-05-20 22:49:06"}

I was pretty discouraged, cynical, and less than hopeful I would ever be able to enjoy a memorable Mexican Restaurant experience again, this year, and it had just started to rain. 10 minutes later, I was already being seated, and, aside from every other table being empty, I found the sounds from the kitchen, the background music, and the salsa server bee-lining toward the table, were all singing to me, \"everything is gonna be all right\". That's when the hostess suddenly apologized for the restaurant having JUST run out of margarita mix. That's when super Daniel came to the rescue. Daniel, without even blinking or flinching said, \"Don't worry, I can make a margarita\". I went from hopeless, to hopeful, to ecstatic. I didn't have to look any further. I was finally where I had been looking to be for months. Don't lose Daniel!!!","date":"2020-06-09 18:36:09"}

What fun!! Happy hour is from 4-6 with various apps and drinks on special! Since it was Tuesday, they also, had tacos and margarita. \n\nWe did sit outside, even though it was hot, we found a table in the shade. Luckily for us, it was earlier in the afternoon and when the sun moved, we moved to a table that was in the shade. If you are planning on spending any time there in the afternoon, keep in mind the sun will move and you may not start out in the sun you will probably end up in the sun or moving tables. \n\nThe margarita was amazing. I also, tried the house wine. The server said they switched the house. I wasn't super thrilled with Cabernet Sauvignon they had that week. It was super blah and no flavor.  I switched over to a lovely Tempranillo. They really have a nice wine selection. \n\nWith us starving, we decided to order a few dishes to share. Many of the menu items have 2 prices. One price is for a single serving of that dish and the next price is a larger serving. We ordered a couple of apps and the larger dish of the scallops. The food came out super fast, again, they weren't very crowded. Food was so goooooood!! They really have fresh and tasty flavors. We got the brussel sprouts with bacon. The brussels were a little under cooked and while they had a good flavor it wasn't super good. We also, had the calamari which was totally amazing, super fresh and still hot, the calamari was super tasty. The scallops were on bed of spinach and sweet potato rounds. DIVINE. So good.\nOur server was super attentive and really nice. He took time to help us make some choices and make sure everything was ok.","date":"2018-10-19 17:50:07"}

We went on the Friday after Thanksgiving.  About 20% of the shops were closed...  There was no indoor seating...  If you did manage to find a chair that wasnt removed, security came along fast to move you along...  My wife is 8 months pregnant, so they let her be for the most part.\n\nSo since the last trip was a little dismal, I will post what we have come to love about this place.

After the first time we only bought 2 cookies, now we know to get 2-3 dozen! hahahaha!\n\nI am a huge fan of Corned Beef and Pastrami, but as a NYer, we know Jewish style is the best!  Places by us are $30-40 per lb, or 20+ a sandwich, but good ol Hershels is a normal price!  $10 per sandwich, and $14 per lb!  Its worth it to drive down lol!\n\nSince we arent locals, the produce isnt that big for us, but we love getting spices and seasonings from the Head Nut and the Herbiary.\n\nWe also love getting unique items from Amys place!  Highly recommend!\n\nThey also have several butchers that you can get fresh meats from.  We really love getting sausages and so many other items like steaks and sometimes fish.  Dont forget a cooler!\n\nThey also have about 10 stores that are direct from Lancaster Amish country!    Fresh butter, fresh eggs, fresh produce!  Make sure that you stop at Beilers for a donut and cake!  Millers also does amazing pretzels!  Make sure that you like butter.\n\nIf there is something that you are looking for, and do not know where to get it, 99% of the time, you can find everything that you need here!","date":"2020-12-02 19:36:34"}

And in fact, our conversation that day was centering around good local places that offer up vegetarian dishes, which was exactly why I hadn't tried Happy Dragon before, because I didn't see any vegetarian option on their paper menus that sometimes ended up attached to  our mailboxes in the neighborhood. \nShe told me that she discovered that they will substitute tofu for any other protein in nearly every menu item they offer. And even better, they won't upcharge you to do so! Needless to say, she had my full attention as we continued our conversation.\nThe next time the rest of the family decided they really wanted Chinese takeout for dinner, I said I was willing to try Happy Dragon, and they couldn't believe it. We all grabbed our devices of choice and pulled up their menu on Yelp. I made a bold choice and ordered the General Tso Tofu. I'm pushing 50 years old and I've never ordered General Tso's anything, because it's always meat-based. I was so excited to try it!\nAll of the takeout containers were really good sized. You definitely got a lot for your money. For a person like me, that means that I've got a meal today and definitely a lunch tomorrow too!\nThe General Tso's Tofu was piping hot when I opened it up. In fact, everyone's meals were piping hot. And I don't know how much you know about tofu, but it retains its specific heat quite well. My container of white rice was hot too. The General Tso sauce was sweet and tangy, and had just enough of a kick in it, that it made my nose runny after a few bites. My whole plate had an electric orange glow to it as I was eating. \nThis menu item doesn't comes with any sides, which is just fine, because I was stuffed after eating only half of the portion. \nCOVID-19 UPDATE:\nAfter having a positive first experience here, we decided to order again to support local business during this pandemic. However, when we went over there, the signed says they are closed. We have no idea the scope of this closure, but we hope they are able to open back up when things are in a better way and safer.","date":"2020-04-21 18:28:21"}

My boyfriend and I came here for lunch on a Wednesday and this place was packed! Luckily, we were only a party of 2 so we were immediately seated at the bar. The menu is not too extensive and does not have the option of sashimi only. It's primarily only nigiri sushi, narrow choice of appetizers, maki rolls, and desserts. However, they do have uni on their menu! (only one serving per person).\n\nWe tried almost all of their nigiri sushi options, salmon, maguro, squid, scallop, hamachi, uni, unagi, mussels, fried calamari, snow mountain, and spider roll. The items that stood out more in terms of quality and taste were the squid, uni, salmon, and unagi sushi. We both agreed that the squid was the winner that day, it was creamy, sweet, and savory. The one we didn't like the most was the scallop. It was not fresh, tasteless, and tasted like it was just defrosted from the fridge not long ago. The dessert choices were limited to only one per person. We got the green tea ice cream and mochi. The mochi outer layer was hard and not soft. Both didn't have much of a green tea taste unfortunately. \n\nThe service was attentive and we really liked our sushi chef. There were a few ones that he forgot, but overall, we were impressed by his memory of our sushi orders.

I'm not a fan of their cookies nor their slow service. \n\nChocolate chip cookies are ho-hum on the flavor scale. They don't have a buttery taste but more specifically, these lack a rich chocolate punch. I assume this is because they use milk chocolate chips for a mellow cookie instead of semi-sweet chocolate chips, which is what traditional chocolate chip cookies are made of. \n\nToday we tried the pumpkin pie cookie and it was a huge disappointment. It was a overly sweet pumpkin filling on top of a sugar cookie. Instant headache after a few bites. \n\nThe pumpkin pie cookie is a huge fail. Using quality ingredients produces a superior end product. It tastes like sweeteners and sugar was added to compensate for subpar recipe ingredients. \n\nAs for service, they perhaps are still perfecting the timing of orders being placed vs pick up. No matter what, there's always an extra 5-10 minute wait from your pickup time. \n\nI'll continue to drive across the bridge to Insomnia Cookies for nighttime snacks.","date":"2021-11-24 04:00:33"}

I've been here twice now, once at the communal table outside in warmer months, once inside. Both times I was blown away by the food and drinks and the friendly, knowledgeable service. \n\nFirst off, you need to get the mushroom and egg pizza. It does not mention its most exciting ingredient: pickled mustard seeds. Perhaps this is so you are surprised and delighted when you first taste it; perhaps it is so you feel that you are in an exclusive club who knows to order this. (Must mention the divine wood-fired sourdough crust, too.)\n\nOther items on the menu are similarly coy. Potato soup gave little indication of how flavor packed it would be other than \"smoky.\" Grilled cabbage had \"who knew?\" sauce and buckwheat. If you trust the chef (which you should!), it's an exciting way to eat, and inspires your server to be your guide, which they are well qualified to do. \n\nNow the drinks: I had a red (which was actually a rose?) that defies description. It was light, not tannic, but bursting with fruit flavor. One of my tablemates had an Austrian white she described as smelling like it would taste normal, but then surprising you with layered flavors. The other had a cider from Normandy that, I kid you not, tasted of blue cheese--and it was a good thing. We brought home a number of bottles from their wine shop. Can I just say how ecstatic I am that I can buy wine in Pennsylvania from someone who knows about it--and it's natural wine that is not a concentrated pesticide bomb? This is heaven.\n\nMy one complaint is that the bass inside was cranked up so high that I felt a bit nauseated. I am admittedly very sensitive to this kind of thing, having been raised by an audiophile, but it did seem pretty extreme for dinner time not at a club.

I would NEVER recommend this place, they do not respect patients and should not have the business of anyone.\n\nI scheduled a new patient appointment and was not able to get in for a month due to their limited availability. As a full time employee my \"free\" time is scarce so I wanted to assure an on time appointment, the receptionist recommended 1:30 as they require new patients to check in a  1\/2 hour before the appointment and they got back from lunch at 1:00 so assured me they would be caught up with patients and on time. \n\nI showed up at 12:50 and waited until 1:25 before any of the unfriendly staff decided to come back from lunch. They gave a pathetic apology and continued laughing amongst each other while ignoring the 2 patients who had both been waiting over a half hour. \nI immediately went to\n\n the front desk as now I was on a tight time crunch with a meeting at 3:00, I asked the receptionist if I would be able to get right in and she informed me that new patients need to be there 30 minutes before their appointment so I would have to wait 30 minutes. Are you kidding me, I had been waiting nearly 45 minutes while they took their time at lunch!!!!! She proceeded to let me know that the doctor was not even in and she didn't know what time they could expect her, again are you kidding me, my actual appt was at 1:30 so why would the doctor not be in the office when she had an appointment.\n\nI left after they continued to tell me they could not estimate what time I would be able to get in and they did not know where the doctor was. It was so disheartening to know that the office staff did not care one bit about their patients. I respected their time by showing up when told, and they hardly had a thought about leaving us waiting outside. They never tried to be polite and understanding, in fact, I got the feeling they didn't want patients so that they could continue gossiping.","date":"2014-06-10 22:44:08"}

It came out as a whopping whole fish topped with a delicious slightly spicy and tangy chopped onion sauce (ok that might sound a bit nasty but it makes the dish, trust me!). For being grilled it was still really crispy on the outside with the meat still juicy, and such a great deal at only $12! Every entree comes with one large side so I got the Senegal fried rice, which was pretty good, not flavorful enough to be a main dish but a nice complement to the fish.\n\nMy friend's poulet Senegal (Senegalese chicken) was a giant portion of well spiced, tender chicken topped with a fantastic caramelized onion sauce (honestly it was even better than the chicken!). I don't like fried plantains but objectively they looked good and crispy. \n\nWhile the menu is small and there are distinct lunch or dinner only options, the food is unique and filling.

Me and my friend came to brunch and I'm giving this review 3 stars because they cap you on bottomless mimosas during brunch and food was just okay. A long time ago when I came here they didn't have a limit so we were upset when we got there and got kicked out for being there for too long. Bottomless mimosas are $20 a person but again it's not bottomless. They bring you a pitcher of mimosas which was nice so you didn't have to wait for refills but they limited us to one pitcher each and they put a limit on how long we could be there.  That is so annoying! I live in Spring Hill and when I make the drive down to tampa to brunch with friends, we like to sit and chill at one place, catch up and we will drink and eat all day. The longer you allow us to stay, the more money we will spend, I get having to get people in and out but it just sucks when your rushed.  The pretzel was fantastic and the candied bacon was meh.

After church Sunday Tony and I decided to eat out and then head straight to the grocery store. We enjoy eating at the Daily Buffet & Grill because of variety they offer. There is a medium size salad bar which has peel and eat shrimp, marinated baby octopus, and your normal salad items. They have a sushi bar that is done beautifully, but it isn't too big. Right by the sushi is a hibachi grill that I dearly love! You fill your own plate and hand it to the grill master and he gives it back steaming hot. You can pile your plate with shrimp, pork, steak, two kinds of noodles, snow peas, garlic, hot peppers, and all kinds of veggies. If you get the things I've mentioned you already have way more than your monies worth, BUT-there are still the 5-6 rows of oriental\/American buffet tables. Don't forget dessert and the 6 types of ice cream that you hand dip yourself. The Hibachi is still wonderful, but unfortunately the quality of the other rows of food were either room temperature or just plain cold. Some of the flavors were way off too. For instance the crab Rangoon filling just wasn't right. There were three of us in agreement. Another example was the Hot And Sour Soup. It's normally very good here. It should be a little bit spicy and a little bit sour.  It looked so good, but was only Salty!! I'm afraid that we have decided not to eat here for a long while.","date":"2020-01-20 21:30:59"}

I can't even properly describe the array of unique flavors on the plate, but let me tell you that this is a must order. \n\nEqually exciting were the Baklava Pancakes. The rose water infused syrup was  chef's kiss. The mascarpone cream layered between the blue pancakes and bananas was wonderful, although the pumpkin flavor was lost on me.

Not the most solid source but turned out to be pretty nice. The entrance is down a little alleyway off of Main St and you walk right into a big open area with a little stage for live music off to your left and a sushi bar just behind the hostess stand. Considering this is a brewery we were a little confused about the sushi, but also being people that love sushi, we were happy about it. We asked to sit outside because we saw they had outdoor seating and boy do they. A short walk through the indoor seating brings you out into the outdoor but half covered bar and seating area. The bar itself is covered but when you walk a little bit past the bar there is additional outdoor seating, as well as a countertop to sit and overlook the Schuylkill river flowing by. \n\nWe sat at the bar as we wanted to try out the happy hour (4-7pm, 1 dollar off all drinks and discounted food). I started off with the Monk from the Yonk and it was very good, tasted almost like a Golden Monkey from Victory Brewing if you are familiar with that. My girlfriend got the Moscow mule which was also delicious and my sister got the Brew Cider Sangria which was interesting but good. The bartenders were very nice and answered all of our questions we had. \n\nAs for the food, we ordered the wings, the chicken quesadilla, and the pizza, all off of the happy hour menu. The wings were wonderful and almost comparable to a wing restaurant, although we aren't really sure what flavor we got as we were never asked, it was very good regardless. The chicken quesadilla was awesome as well and they definitely did not hold back on the ingredients like some places do for quesadillas. Finally the pizza, it was alright but just tasted like a frozen pizza you would make at home.  \n\nOverall, it's a great scene and I definitely will be coming back to check out the rest of the beer and the large menu.","date":"2019-04-10 01:11:29"}

Brothers, cousins, aunts and uncles; all varying ages. So, we try new places every year that can appeal to our large group, while being interesting to those of us who are lucky enough to be frequent diners around the country. \n\nPesto, in the heart of South Philly blew it away. First, Connie at the front of house, as well as reservations confirmer is a sweetheart who adds to the positive experience by greeting your table and discussing the menu. \n\nOur large group had appetizers served family style, calamari, stuffed mushrooms in rose sauce and bracciolettini which were all devoured by eaters from elementary school through collegians and everything between. \n\nLightly fried calamari ranks among the very best I have had, the bracciolette is new to me and many at the table. Thinly sliced beef, grilled, and rolled with mozzarella like pillows of flavor. Pro tip from Connie, dip them in the rose sauce of the mushrooms...just....delicious. \n\nThe two dishes I tried both are calling me back. The Veal mare and monti are medallions topped with shrimp and prosciutto in a mushroom Demi glacé. Texturally and taste make this an experience as well as dinner. \n\nThe entrée that the 15 yo raved about is the house made cavatelli with crab, lobster and shrimp. Unsurprisingly the cavatelli won a national award on a tv show and it shows. \n\nDesserts included cakes to gelato. Wine here is so reasonably priced you'll be shocked. \n\nCouple more things. There is a hospital parking garage across Broad street. Safe, 24 hours, staffed lobby, park after 5 pm for $6 bucks. \n\nCarrots: Connie had the waiter bring a gratis carrot salad in balsamic that NONE of us ever had and we are now figuring out how to make ourselves. \n\nFor center city denizens, come to this South Philly standout and experience a true Italian dinner experience","date":"2022-01-01 17:26:40"}

As a result, I raised my opinion to the 2 star status. \nMy brother, his child , and I went to the Arnold location for dinner Friday 1-14-11 night at the last minute. As we walked through the door at 7:10 PM, we both felt relieved the restaurant was only about half full. The three of us were seated quickly and given menus. A perky and waitress came to our table quickly, took our drink orders, and explained the menu to us. This is where the good vibe stops. \nOnce our drinks (lemonade, Coke, and a Smitthwick's) were brought to the table we lost our waitress for fifteen minutes. \nI was able to get the server's attention and tell her we were ready to order. I also, without attitude, asked if she was really busy tonight because we wanted to see more of her. The four of us spoke and joked around in a friendly manner and we asked for more drinks. \nAfter another fifteen minutes of searching for our server, we resorted to going to the bar to refill our drinks. \nAnother ten minutes went by and the waitress was directed to our table, we let her know the drinks were paid for at the bar and should not be on our tab. We also asked if the kitchen was alright as it had been quite a while since we ordered (chicken strips, hamburger, and steak sandwich). The waitress didn't believe we went to the bar and offered no explanation or apology for the lack of attention. \nSensing our mounting displeasure, a second waitress brought our food to the table and dropped the plates without a word or even a smile. \nMy medium-rare burger was nearly well done and the fries on all three plates were over fried to the point none of us ate them. Food must be fairly bad for my family to turn away. \nThe chicken strips were not eaten and I could only get down about a quarter of my dry sandwich. After another 20 minute wait, our waitress came to the table to see how we were doing. \nWe told the server we were not happy with the time nor the food. WE asked for the check now, because, \"Who knows when we'll see you again?\" \nWe paid in cash, fearful to leave a credit card number with the place, and left an appropriate tip. \nIt takes a lot for me to leave a poor review. I'm usually understanding about off-days, crowded nights, and complicated orders; but there was no excuse for this meal to be this bad and take this long! \n\nOn the plus side, the staff was extremely attractive and the outfits leave little to the imagination.

In fact, we stepped right up to the counter, ordered and was seated immediately.  The restaurant is surprisingly modern with a hipster vibe, but they do put out an awesome breakfast, with a superb cup of coffee and freshly squeezed orange juice.

Possibly because my expectations were off the charts, based on other sandwiches I've tried from that esteemed list I referenced earlier.  Or maybe it's just that I'm not a huge fan of chicken thigh meat.  I'd much prefer a big ole juicy breast.  I found the biscuit to be a little more dense and not as flaky as I'd like, but still damned good.  The sausage gravy and aged white cheddar cheese did pull it all together and make for a unique combo.  \n\nThe service was very good but felt a little rushed.  Our food actually arrived at the table ahead of the coffee and orange juice.  Not a big deal, but it felt a little off.  Same thing happened to the table next to us, so maybe it's their thing?  But just for the record, I'd prefer to get a few sips of my coffee before the food arrives.  Too picky?

If you're seeking that flavor, this is a great choice!\n- Asparagus Crepe - for asparagus lovers,this is a must have. \n- Grilled Seitan - some of the best seitan that I've had at any vegetarian\/vegan restaurant. \n\nDirt List:\n- Seared Broccoli Rabe - wonderful set of greens if you're looking for that.\n- Nebrodini Mushrooms - if you're a mushroom lover, these are to die for and you HAVE to get them.\n\nDessert:\n- Saffron Cheesecake - the rhubarb ice cream is freaking fantastic as is everything about the cheesecake.\n- Togarashi Milk Duds - unfortunately, I was not into this. It is a more savory dessert so if you're looking for a not sweet and dryer dessert. \n\nFinally, the service was really great. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and will take your tastes into mind when offering recommendations. Go!","date":"2015-05-31 00:55:56"}

There was only other one patron inside on a Saturday at 9am, but the donuts looked as pretty as ever. I paid $7.25 for the two (one cake-style, one filled) and while this is the going rate for a dozen at the typical donut shop, these should not be included within that same echelon. Rather, I'd compare these confections with the artisan pastries you'd find at your local bakery or coffeehouse. \n\nBoth donuts were very good. The browned butter had the perfect sweet\/savory combination, and the eggnog creme brûlée was perfectly crisped on the outer shell just like the real deal. The eggnog filling was particularly tasty as well. \n\nWill this spot last in Santa Barbara? I sure hope so.

Terrible.  Loews is not a \"resort\" & barely a hotel.  Planned to have a spa vacation with a friend.  We are both native Arizonans and were coming back for a little R&R.   It was early October, still warm, therefore the \"slow\" season.  We got a good deal on the room, but the rest was downhill.\n\nArrived, the valet was overly chatty. Told us we could either park ourselves or valet depending on where our room was and our preference.  Didn't mention that it was $9\/day either way.\n\nPorter wouldn't stop talking as he brought our bags up.  He wouldn't leave either.  So we finally shoved $10 in his hand & showed him the door.  A larger tip than deserved, but we just wanted him to leave.\n\nThat night we spoke to 3 different people about the Ventana hike (on the resort property).  Each of them told us something different:  \"12 miles round trip,\"  \"6 miles round-trip and you should plan for several hours,\"  \"I think it's about 4 miles, but here's a pamphlet on it, all the details are in it.\"  The pamphlet was just as confusing as the descriptions from the hotel employees.  So, we figured we would just start out on the trail and go as far as we could until we felt like turning around and coming back.\n\nDinner the first night was ok, but expensive.  \n\nI had my lap top, tried to figure out how to connect to the internet.  The message that comes up is \"applicable charges may apply...\"   Really?  Seriously?  Well, ok, if you insist on nickel-and-diming me, then what the hell is the fee?  It was vague enough that I just turned off the computer.  Didn't want to risk being charged $20\/day for internet access when I could do the routine stuff on my iPhone.\n\nReading the hotel guide in the room trying to figure out which spa treatments to do, then realized there was a daily fee to use the hotel gym.  Seriously?\n\nNext morning, had breakfast.  It was fine, portions were big, but nothing spectacular.  Went to the spa to make reservations for the afternoon... lady at the counter was a horrible person.  The fake salesperson.  She listened to my friend and I discuss the treatment options, she told us which massages were the most popular, which ones treatments were no longer offered, etc.  We were entertaining the idea of purchasing a package, $250 for 3 treatments.  She said, \"well, you'll have to do all the treatments in one day, we can't split them up...\"  Seriously, the resort is empty, is it such a big deal to split up the treatments?  We were only there for 2 days.  Fine, we each picked a massage, we scheduled our time.\n\nWent for the hike.  Dry season, not the best AZ hike, good exercise, but not very pretty.  Came back to the \"resort\" through the back, walked by a t.v. monitor that was advertising things for the resort, on the monitor in a flash we see something that says, \"Spa Happy Hour...\"  Waited for the loop to go around.  Apparently there are spa deals to be had.\n\nWent to the front desk to inquire.  That person had no idea what the Spa Happy Hour was.  Bellhop, had no idea.  Went to the Concierge who had no idea.  Finally she called the spa... multiple treatments offered during the slow season for 1\/2 price.  The bitchy lady at the spa never told us there were specials.  May have changed our minds on what we scheduled for that afternoon.  We were pissed.  We rescheduled our treatments for the Spa Special Massage.  \n\n1.  Why don't the people at this resort all know their facts?\n2.  Why wouldn't you tell people about spa specials, isn't the point of having a special  to have more people sign up for things?  Afterall, it's the slow season.\n3. Why would a \"resort\" nickel-and-dime the customer.  It's unbelievably irritating to be charged $5 for this $10 for that, just add it into the price of the room.  Seriously, the Holiday Inn offers free wi-fi, so WTF?\n\nDinner that night was fine, not great and not worth the money.  I live in NYC now, so when I pay $60 for dinner, I want it to be really good....\n\nNext day, went to have brunch.  My friend ordered the fish tacos, asked the server if the tortillas were corn or flour because she has a gluten allergy.  He said, \"pretty sure they are corn.\"  Our food arrives, he sets the tacos down in front of her and says, \"oh I was wrong, they are flour tortillas, is that ok.\"  I finally said, no it's not okay.  She has an allergy.  his response, \"it's no big deal we can make them with corn it will just take a couple minutes...\"\n\nSo many things wrong with this interaction:\n1.  Why wouldn't the server come back out and ask beforehand if flour was okay.  Why would he bring the food out and then ask?\n2.  If it's so damn easy to make them with corn, then make the f***ing tacos with corn tortillas\n3.  The correct tacos were brought back by a manager.  We never saw the server again... (chickens**t, he was probably afraid we would rip him a new one).  Manager offered us a free dessert.  How lame.\n\nWORST EXPERIENCE EVER.","date":"2009-11-14 15:04:49"}

It seemed that his primary concern was his guests on the tour. He wanted to make sure you were being taken care of. The service everywhere was great; they were happy to see us but I can't say the same at the Batch. We visited several great restaurants and the stops progressively became more filling. We started with perfectly made cold brewed coffee with a wonderful heavy grained bread with jelly at Sparkroot. Next was the Hub where we sampled several of their wonderful ice creams we all loved each flavor we tried and had some of their famous corned-beef with was lean and tender along with very tasty filling, crispy cheese curds. Then to Empire Pizza and had a slice of great Margarita pizza. On to Reilly for brussel sprouts (a little greasy) and bruschetta with prosciutto. At La Cocina we had a Thai peanut quinoa salad; very good. Then the famous El Charro for tamales, I tried the pork it was good but a little spicy for me. All alcohol was on our own dime and at El Charro I had a Margarita and it was amazing, perfect combo of sweet and sour. Last stop was the Batch known for it donuts and boubon.

We called ahead of time to make a reservation and asked if they do anything special for birthdays. Turns out they do! They actually decorated the table and had a special menu with my mother's name on it. For dessert, they brought my mom a plate with a piece of chocolate truffle and happy birthday written on it. For reservations of 5 or more, they require that you call to make your reservation instead of doing it online. Beware there is a $20 charge per person if you don't show up to your reservation. The interior of the restaurant was unique and definitely had the feelings of a upscale restaurant. Since we came during coolinary month, they had a special going on that offered an certain appetizer, entree, and dessert for the price of $39. There were 3 appetizers, entrées, and desserts to choose from. As appetizers for the table, we had the tempura fin wings and the barbecue shrimp. People in our party who did coolinary had either lobster bisque, tuna tacos, or the royal red shrimp as their appetizer. As entrees, we either had fried soft shell crab, wasabi crusted wahoo, or the mackerel. For the two individuals who didn't do Coolinary, they had the New Bedford sea scallops and chicken breast as their entree. The desserts that we had were pecan pie, carrot cake, and sorbet. Everything was amazing! I loved how certain dishes had a Southeastern Asian flare to it. We all really enjoyed the food. The seafood was super fresh. Soft shell crabs were a very good size. Food portions were solid. On top of all this, service was definitely one of the best I ever experienced. The waiter and the others who helped always made sure that we had everything that we needed. Waters were constantly refilled. Empty plates were always picked up in a timely manner. I cannot rave enough about this place. It definitely can get expensive but I would definitely recommend it for anyone who is celebrating a special occasion and are in search of fresh seafood in the downtown area!\n\nP.S.

When we got in, I had two drinks at the bar. The next day while at breakfast, I checked my credit card statement and I noticed my card was never actually run. Weird. So I mentioned it to the restaurant manager. Part of me thought she would have done what I would have done back in my Ritz Carlton managerial days: thank the guest for their honesty and tell them not to worry about the charge. But she actually never once thanked me for my honesty and for bringing that to her attention and instead went out of her way to charge the card. She asked what I got and I told her. She couldn't find these particular wines on the menu in the restaurant at which point I was sure she would say 'hey do not worry about it, just come back and see us.'..Or something to that effect that you'd expect from a four seasons. Instead she and the host went on a search in the bar for the menu I had ordered from to figure out exactly how much to charge me. In the end, she did charge me for the two glasses of wine I'd had the night before. \n\nOnto breakfast - oomph. I was pretty thrown off by the fact that it seemed like 5 different servers interacted with me during my meal. Who was \"my server\"? It seemed a little too much. I ordered English breakfast tea and the chia pudding with fruit and it was all great. No complaints about the meal itself. The fruit on the chia pudding was particularly delicious and you could tell it was fresh. I would definitely order this again! However, while the food was a hit, the service was a miss for me. When I'd asked the server if the chia pudding was vegan, he did not know. You'd think, again because it's a Four Seasons (!), that they would be extremely knowledgeable about their menu. Of course he did go check for me and assured me that it was. THEN, about halfway through my meal, I had told a server (again, it really was not ever clear who \"my server\" was) that I was going to use the restroom and be right back. I'd taken my wallet and phone with me but had made it clear to him that I'd be returning. When I got back from the restroom 5 minutes later, the entire table was cleared. What?! To make a long story short, a couple minutes later they brought back out the same exact meal I'd been eating and I continued on with breakfast. Maybe something you'd expect from your run of the mill Hilton? Not what you expect at a Four Seasons. Did not receive any apologies for clearing the table either. Again, I put myself in that situation as a server (or manager) at a 5-star property and I 100% would have brought the guest an entirely new meal. The chia pudding cost them maybe $3 to make and they charge somewhere around $16 for it...this is called simple service recovery. In short, was not impressed with the dining experience overall. \n\nOnto the good. Aesthetically, this place is to die for and the location couldn't be beat. Maybe 20 steps from the ocean. The grounds of the hotel are just immaculate. The property is extremely well taken care of from top to bottom and every inch is just beautiful and everything seems exceptionally clean. The entire vibe of the place made me feel like I was on the  Amalfi Coast - particularly the pool area and the tile in the bathrooms. The rooms (and closet especially) are spacious and well done. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back here but would probably choose to eat out rather than dining at the restaurant again.","date":"2019-09-22 00:34:09"}

This is the cheapest I've seen korean food (compared to other places in Boston and Philadelphia), and the portions are very generous. The bulgogi burrito is my go-to, especially since it's a two-mealer and I think it's a more interesting concept than traditional Korean food. The stone pots are very good as well, although it comes with the fried egg on top fully cooked (I think the norm is sunny-side-up style instead). The pork fried rice is pretty generic and flavorless--I'm not a fan of the cubed carrot and pea mix they use. I was looking forward to the wings, but they're TINY and totally not worth it. I don't believe we received any banchan (side dishes) when came in person, and definitely not through delivery\n\nThe decor is pretty no-frills, and there's some picnic tables for outdoor seating.

I entertained them one time thinking it could not hurt to get an estimate, but they would not just get down to the task of doing that. Instead the salesman put me on the phone with his supervisor. This seemed weird. After a few minutes of this it became clear they were using the kind of sales tactics designed to wear you down that other reviewers have mentioned. So I handed him back the phone. \n\nSince then they have knocked on my door at least twice. The most recent time I very politely told them I was not interested and even added \"Have a nice day.

It was a beautiful sunny morning with a bit of wind reminding you that winter was just here and if that nature wants it can turn around and makes us miserable in a less than a blink of an eye (shouldn't that be blink of the eyes).\n\nI would tell you that if you are looking for some fancy joint with ultra hot Latin Americans just slightly malnourished so that they fit in their designer outfits and a chic decor this would not be the place.  Is in Northeast Philadelphia on north 5th Street.  Small place hard to find unless you know the colors of the Colombian Flag decorated across the middle with the establishments name.  The group consisted of a good Colombian friend with her husband and my partner and I (also Hispanic).  \nI would advise to invite a friend that knows to speak fluent Spanish or you can always point at what you want and go for it as you can see everything through a pastry showcase.  The establishment is set up as a bakery even thought you can get items that you would generally not expect to be served in one.  \n\nIf you order coffee make sure that you specify without sugar because all coffee served comes with it included. Of course it comes included I mean they already poured about seven spoons of sugar in your cup.\n\nThe food is truly authentic and made fresh. The place is so popular that they need to constantly refill their hot foods. Get there before the after church crowd arrives; trust me.\n\nThe tamales are the biggest one's I have seen from here to Bogotá, made with large pieces of chicken inside ,potatoes and peas. They melt in your mouth and are delicious.  \nThey prepare two kinds of  are arepas to keep it simple the white ones are not sweet and have been sliced through the middle to add the single most important food group: Cheese;  and the yellow ones are sweet.  There is Colombian chorizo which is like a mildly spicy Kielbasa not like the traditional Spanish one. Consider also the empanadas caleñas, orejitas, tres leches, etc. \n\nThe cleanliness of the place is superb. The staff is friendly, courteous and attractive but not starved.  Very inexpensive so do not ignore the tip jar on the counter.  Tipping is not a place in China!!!\n\nIs definite worth the trip!!!","date":"2009-04-05 20:13:54"}

Some ballparks have local specialties (Philly Cheesesteaks, Clam Chowdah, Elotes, etc.) and apparently Busch Stadium does not.  Only a ton of Budweiser brand beer.  \n\nTickets are at least cheap enough (this is still a stadium that offers standing-room only tickets and cheaply priced bleacher seats) that you can wander around with your cheap ticket and find another place to sit and no one will kick you out.\n\nGlad I had the opportunity to go and, since it's so close, will probably be back again but this stadium isn't really anything special.","date":"2016-02-06 04:22:36"}

Then Central Airpark is for you. \n\nLet me set the scene for you - . It's cold out. You think to yourself that there's something strangely comical about arriving at an airport parking lot at 5AM only to see no shuttles in sight and no conceivable signs of life anywhere. As you wait a few minutes and lose faith in the arrival of your savior shuttle, you walk up to the toll window only to see nobody there and no sign indicating whether or not anyone will be there. You will call their phone number only to hear their phone ring from within the office and nobody will come out to assist you. Stricken with panic, you will run back to your car, temporarily forgetting how cold it is, temporarily forgetting all that's been lost about what used to be your humanity. You will pull up to the toll booth to see a heavy gate blocking your way. You will honk. You will honk hoping that the heavens (or at least someone with a way to open this damn gate) will hear you. You will contemplate ramming the gate and using Spot parking (right across the street and looking very much open) so that you can get to your flight on time. In a last ditch effort, you will try the door of the tollkeeper's office and cross the threshold. Inside the belly of the beast - Putting your physical presence inside of this office will awaken the gatekeeper from her humble slumber. She will look at you as if you are the one annoying her - as if you are the one who is possibly invalidating her 400 dollar plane ticket that is not exchangeable and not refundable. You will exchange quick words and she will assure you that the shuttle is on its way. Tired and unwilling to risk any more disappointment, you will reluctantly stay...\n\n...and they will cancel your frequent parker's card. They will ignore any and all attempts for you to get it reactivated. They will conveniently forget that you've been parking here reliably for about 4 years. They will forget all the times you've forgiven them for taking 25 minutes to show up after picking up your luggage. Central Airpark is a poorly-run company with nothing but contempt for its customer base. I've rarely wanted a business to wither and die the way I want this one to.","date":"2013-12-17 14:32:06"}

I asked if we could all look at the inventory on line together and he was happy to help. Come to find out, my husband noticed that the search he did was customized to above our budget. Long story short we ended up giving them a HOLDING deposit of $500 and told that we needed to contact him when the financing got approved prior to them prepping it for sale.\nWe found a better trailer that would meet our family needs much better for a similar price at another dealership. When we called Geoff at Camping World to inform him of our new find, we were absolutely appalled at his response. He not only was absolutely disrespectful, he threatened to send us a bill for the work that had been done to the trailer, send our information to \"management\" prior to hanging up on us. Please keep in mind, we didn't request any work be done, we never signed any paperwork promising to buy the trailer. \nIf that isn't bad enough, we stopped in to get our holding deposit check back and they refused to give it to back to us.\nI'm not usually a person that complains about companies or customer service because I know we all have our bad days.

And then I came here for brunch and was blown away. Who is your cook? I want to kiss him. The blueberry ricotta pancakes were fluffy AF and no syrup needed. And the truffle tots?!! Jesus Christ. One of the best things I ever put in my mouth. The house Bloody Mary had me saying Hail Marys after every sip it was soooo good. And the service was exceptional. Our waiter was quick, not hovering and friendly. And the table next to us was a group of fabulous wig wearing dolls out for a bachelorette. Their waitress didn't skip a beat. I don't think I ever saw their mimosa glasses empty. I will be coming back here for many brunch's.","date":"2021-05-02 18:30:51"}

It's honestly the same except instead of a Sam's Club or BJ's, they canvassed some neighborhoods.  We were interested in a new roof anyway.\n\nThe sales pitch is long.  I told our sales guy that I was okay with the material, polypropylene woven fiber, because I was familiar with it due to my profession.  I knew it wouldn't be cheap.  That said, he told me it was required that he finish his sales pitch even if I was okay with the price and the materials.  But that's not what the 2 stars is for since I'm okay with people doing their jobs.  There were a few issues, two I consider major, which is the cause of this poor review.\n\nThe small issue was that we needed to contact our insurance for an inspection first.  Because of that we scheduled the repair 2 weeks out, but then within a couple of days the manager for the actual work was at our home and tried to schedule it for just a few days after that.  So either the sales guy didn't know this would happen or knew and lied.  If he didn't know?  Then they need better communication or they risk annoying some customers, like me!  They need to give people time to get their financial and insurance stuff together if they care as much as they claim! \n\nTheir sales pitch is that their employees are not day labor, wear hard hats and harnesses as PPE, physically cover the side of your home and make sure everything is directly disposed and there is no debris all over your yard.  The first crew to show up that was tearing up the roof wore no PPE and covered NOTHING in our yard!  They just threw a piece of tarp down - didn't even straighten it out- and then just threw it near the tarp.  This brings me to issue #2: debris was falling into our AC unit and my husband had to tell them to cover it.  Their covering was to lean a piece of particle board against it which is nothing like what they show you during their sales pitch.  So don't believe this BS hype because that's all it is!  The group of guys actually putting the roof on wore a harness, but no hard hats.  Luckily they are insured, but I took pics using my home camera of their work to be safe.  My husband also went out into the yard and took some pics while they were doing work.  \n\nAnd the last reason they get 2 stars?  We found a small issue within the week, my husband called to talk their warranty group and left a message.  They never returned our call.  I has been taken care of, but they should return their customer's calls especially within a week of a new install.  \n\nThey didn't replace any interior beams like they said they would though.  The sales guy and another inspector marked several beams they claimed they would replace - this is just another BS sales pitch since they only replaced one!  So don't buy their claims about upgrading all of your old or damaged roofing.  Don't even use them because they use polypropylene (PP) - get several opinions and go with whatever you want.  They try to make it sound like they stand out and are different from beginning to end, but the only difference I can see is the polymer instead of tar paper.  Other than this, the roof looks fine and most of the people we dealt with were nice.","date":"2020-03-01 03:41:27"}

Normally not an issue, but one of our company had muscular dystrophy and stairs were a challenge. We assisted our friend up in expectation of the fantastic beverages that were to come. Tonight especially, a taste of 'Root'; the new locally brewed spirit.\n\nWe sat at the very small upstairs bar and were given samples of root. It was very nice, a bit sweet for me, and discussed the possibility of mixing it with a prosecca to enhance the base flavors and tone down the sweet.\n\nUnfortunately for us, Nick and Christian were no where to be found, so our discussions were for naught. The waitress who assisted us had no mixology skill, and Sam, the official barkeep, said not ONE WORD to us the hour we were there, nor did he bother to make a drink for us or inquire if we wanted one.\n\nThe waitress ended up making our drinks, which we agreed were lame and tame compared to the vivid flavors we are used to from this place. We considered a second round, but after waiting for fifteen minutes with dry glassware I finally gave in and tendered my credit card, paying forty five (yes $45) dollars for the three drinks we had. \n\nWhen we first starting coming here, drinks were great, service was brilliant, and we were excited to be part of the Apothecary scene.

Luckily they are not just nice, but make some great coffee! \n\nPer my first review, I still love the lavender latte. Their seasonal lattes have been fun to try (fall was my favorite).

The consistent ones are medium or dark roast but usually the rotating one is light (which I vastly prefer!). \n\nThe seating is great! This place is usually pretty busy, as a head's up, most of the time. They have some comfy sitting chairs in a couple corners, have a high table with stools running across the window, and tables of varying sizes. The high tables and a couple of the corner areas have outlets, so bring your charger if you're working or studying on a laptop. \n\nDuring warmer weather, you'll want to try the patio at the back of the shop. It's delightful and adorable! \n\nThey have an online order option, both a website and an app. Usually takes only 10-15 min for your brew to be ready. Sometimes they even write nice things on your to-go cup! :) \n\nThe snacks are good as well - their pumpkin muffin is surprisingly great (I am surprised only because I usually hate that flavor) but their chocolate chip cookies are my favorite. \n\nParking is great, with spots in front, on the side, and behind the shop. There's a door at the back of the shop so feel free to park in the back. \n\nAlso important for folks who plan to be there a couple hours: bathrooms are really nice and clean. \n\nAnyways, this is my top coffee shop in the city and we are very lucky to have this within the chain-store happy south side (within a 2 mile radius are 3 Starbucks).","date":"2021-12-17 00:47:58"}

I'll say, for a brief period, my heart ached, and I do still pine for a beef burrito. But that being said, when I built the courage to go to Honest Tom's again a few months back, I couldn't believe the new product. So many places that switch to plant based, end up just trying to figure out how to make something taste as similar to meat as possible. Honest Tom's does so well because they are building meal options that are specific culinary items. The Biff burrito is not simply a beef replacement, it's an entity by itself. It has a totally different flavor profile than the original beef burrito in the best way possible. You can absolutely tell that tons of time was taken to really evaluate how to make the most of the switch-over, and although I do miss some of their original options, their new options are absolutely great ones.","date":"2019-04-28 17:39:34"}

Perfection of sweet and spicy. One of the best cauliflower dish we've had and we've had some great ones at On Swann for example.  We split an entree--the jumbo sea scallop served with  gouda grits, pork belly brussels sprouts and corn purée (34 dollars). The scallops did smell a little fishy  so not the freshest but they were huuuge, cooked well and just  really buttery soft. The grits were amazing. Grits was thick almost like a polenta but so smooth and creamy and flavorful. We loved it! Mussels had  nduja sausage, fennel, leeks, bouillabaisse broth, grilled baguette (18 dollars),l.

They also have cheesesteaks, cutlet sandwiches and salads and seafood platters. I have been coming to Jack's for years and I am sure I will be a customer as long as they are open or I am on this Earth. Get down here and try some of their Sandwiches if you have not already.","date":"2019-10-24 21:55:08"}

This came on a small, rectangle plate.\n\nCurry came in a big bowl - white rice, and a generous service of curry on top and to the side.  No fancy presentation here - just a bowl with rice thrown in, and curry dished over it.  I don't know much about Japanese curry.  My only experience with it is that growing up, we probably had the S&B Golden Curry that you can find at most well-stocked groceries now at least once a month, and I still make it occasionally.  In any case, I liked it.  I'm used to having Japanese curry with the bright yellow, pickled daikon, and I know when I had the curry here before, they offered the pink, pickled daikon (and being Korean, we always had kimchi with it too).  In any case, none was offered, and I didn't think to ask.\n\nI did ask if they were planning on going back to their full menu, and the woman working the front of the house said they were hoping to - I got the feeling she didn't know for sure or the timeline for a shift back to ramen is unknown, so she was dancing around the question a little.\n\nTonkatsu and curry are both close to comfort food for me - they're generally known quantities, and items we'd have at home growing up.

Why is that?\n\nIs it because of that sweet magic you puled off with Kim Yu-Na at the Olympics?\n\nIs it your current World Cup team, who seems to blow up the facebook status updates of my friends every time they so much as sneeze?\n\nIs it your liberal use of TADs in the field of Orthodontics and the crazy final results you get, nonsurgically?\n\nIt could be all of those things, but let's face it.  I know why you look so smug - you've won my stomach over.\n\nIt was a tough battle.  I know that little over a year ago, I tried an item called fish cake at a Korean restaurant.  I wasn't really impressed by it, but that is probably what I got for going in cold and ordering seemingly at random.  This experience put a damper in my appreciation of your cuisine for quite a while and for that I apologize.  I should not have been so foolish.\n\nOver the many months, you'd spring up once in a while, throwing a bi bim bap or kimchee my way.  I had colleagues who would try to set us up at various restaurants and Korean associates would feed me some homemade items.  Even though I always liked you(especially your BBQ skills), I wasn't ready to let you get a secure foothold in my eating itinerary.  Life was just too complicated.  We were friends, but not the kind that called frequently to hang out.\n\nAfter Koreana, something changed.  Things suddenly got serious.  My regular Thai and Japanese go-tos now had a serious competitor.  Places like H-Mart, Miga, and some-Korean-BBQ-place-I-Can't-Remember-The-Name-of paved the way, but Koreana sealed the deal and solidified my serious enthusiasm for Korean food.\n\nKoreana did the following things really freaking well:\nDol sot bi bim bap - very tender beef, egg, and really fresh tasting veggies stirred all together with rice in a clay pot.  After you add the hot sauce to this, you will realize that you sit before something awesome.  If you don't like this hot sauce, you should apologize for your behavior to any friends you have remaining because you are probably an asshole.\n\nKimchi bokeum bop - Spicy fried rice dish with chopped kimchee and egg.  Really great.\n\nGoon mandu - Fried pork and veggie dumplings.  They are good but comparable to dumpings that can be achieved at other Asian food restaurants.\n\nJaeyook dup bap - meat and veggies in a thicker, spicy sauce.  \n\nOh yeah, and the items were pretty darn cheap and pretty darn fast and their hot sauce...oh, be still my beating heart.  It was excellent.\n\nSo you see, (South)Korea, your cuisine will be getting many more of my dining dollars in the years to come.  It has been a long road, but one that I'm happy to have traveled.  \n\nSincerely,\nBrad P.","date":"2010-06-19 12:12:14"}

My friend Ken and I ordered the buttermilk fried persimmons, pork belly and root veggie empanadas, and coffee rubbed beer braised short rib. I expected the persimmons to be sweet, but they were devoid of any flavor, so much so that they tasted like turnips. Sadly, the accompanying marinated red peppers were the highlight of this dish. They actually had flavor. The empanadas were filled with pork belly, which is usually full of flavor, but was sadly lacking here. The root veggies made the filling even more bland. Now the piece de resistance... the short rib was fork tender, but the sauce was too bitter for its own good. The accompanying brown butter brussel sprouts were even more bitter. To taste two bitter components in the same dish doesn't work for me. I feel that this is where something like brown butter carrots would've balanced out the bitter sauce. There were carrots in the mashed potatoes, but not enough to balance the bitterness. I'm quite disappointed in the food.

My first visit here was during Veteran's day when they had a nice discount for military vets so I really appreciated that gesture and had couple of beers and enjoyed the amazing rooftop bar view. \nI then decided to sample some of the food and got the duck confit grilled cheese sandwich which arrived cold and the duck was so full of gristle it was inedible then to add insult to injury I was given a paltry amount of fries with it.  My next visit was as a part of a Yelp Elite perk and this visit went much better and the bar seemed to be far better organized than during my first visit.  I told the manager about my last experience and he comped me another duck confit sandwich that was delicious and the complete opposite of the last one I had been served.  The only other thing that seems a bit off to me here is that they don't offer parking validation for customers of the bar which is standard practice at most of the other places like this in the area.\n\nOverall the view alone is worth the cost of a visit here and that view does come with a premium on the price of the drinks here.  My food experience here would give me some caution but they did make up for the initial bad experience I had and the crab beignets were also very nice.  The portion size of the \"sharables\" section of their menu here I also would say are NOT sharable for the normal appetites of most men I know but maybe they would be for some ladies enjoying snacks and cocktails at this establishment.

Or they could just restaff the store. Unfortunately, I find this to be the case with many pen stores, but Stylus really takes the cake. The employee who \"helped\" me did seem to know her pens, but she does not know her sales. Maybe this is how they are trained, but she had the same delivered lines over and over again. In order to simply hold the pen you're interested in and see if it feels right to you, you have to bring her over to the display case, have her remove it, and then go sit at a special little desk and the employee will sit on the other side and hand you the pen. This is the only way they will do things. This is a nice set up for actually testing the pens, but as someone who knows fountain pens, sometimes I simply want to hold the pen quickly - for 2 or 5 seconds - and establish whether I am comfortable with the pen's weight and barrel width. I don't need it inked up, I don't need paper, I don't want to sit down; I just need to feel the damn pen. You know right away whether you like the feel of the pen and want to try it out, or whether it's not for you. It's really irritating to have to walk back and forth to this little desk. Especially because by the time I've walked to the desk, sat down, waited for her to sit down, been handed the pen, held it, handed it back, and gotten back up... I'VE FORGOTTEN WHAT I WAS LOOKING AT. If you test a pen, they take it behind the desk to clean it right away, which makes me feel bad when I want to test it again 5 minutes later to compare it beside another pen. Normally I would simply pick the pens I want to examine further (AFTER HOLDING THEM) and have them all inked at once, but the layout of the store prevents this. Honestly, if you had a really nice, friendly, personable sales rep, this layout wouldn't be 100% horrible. But throw in an awkward, kind of rude salesperson and you have a recipe to not sell anything because people are afraid to ask to try the darn pens.\n\nI understand the \"boutique\", studio style look. You've tried it. Great. It doesn't work. Please redesign your store like a normal pen store, with jewelry-style counters.  That way, the sales attendant can be on one side, I can be on the other side, and we can hold pens happily all day long. Also, when the pens are being displayed horizontally in a row (stacked), it doesn't make sense to place the price cards in front of the rack left-to-right. They should be stuck beside the pen, or tied to the pen. It does me no good to know that Parker has a range of pens from $80-$800, and they're all on this one rack... it needs to be clearer which pen is which price. And, like most pen stores, the pens should go from cheaper (the cheap Asian brands, Lamy, Conklin) at the front of the store) to more expensive (Sheaffer, Parker, and eventually Mont Blanc at the back of the store). This way I'm not wandering around looking for a mid-range pen, getting distracted by $4,500 Mont Blanc limited editions and missing a display I might like because it's sandwiched between two rainbow racks of $28 Lamy Safaris.\n\nIf you're looking to go in and spend less than $40 on a cheap plastic fountain pen, and your main criteria is that it's got a double-digit price and bright colours, go here and buy the second pen you try. There's NOTHING wrong with that; we all start somewhere, and I encourage you to do this so that you eventually get hooked on fountain pens and give the manufacturers reason to keep producing pens for me to buy. If you're already a serious pen enthusiast, and you might want to handle and test a dozen or so pens, then go.... I don't know, I guess you'll have to move somewhere that has a decent pen store.\n\nPS - I also want to note that when I asked she had a recommendation for a pen with a nib that would bleed less, I was told I would have to use a higher quality paper. I know that paper is the biggest factor when considering ink bleed, but obviously I can't write on $18\/package paper all the time (especially when I'm filling up 3-4 100 page legal pads per week), and a dedicated pen salesperson should be able to come up with SOMETHING.","date":"2012-09-05 00:38:32"}

I have ordered this dish at other restaurants and I have never seen this type of veggies in it. The sauce itself tasted more like a spicy tomato sauce. Maybe if there were higher quality ingredients it would've tasted better but I just couldn't enjoy it. Usually I dip my rice in the sauce but I barely finished the dish. Certainly not something I would order from here again. The tofu itself was perfectly cooked and my miso was delicious. The rice was made exactly as it should be.

My hands are shaking as I type this. I just hung up the phone with the manager of this company. After my cleaning guy left I glanced at my bill and the numbers didn't make sense. \nFirst of all, I bought a Living Social voucher, the $39 one. This states it will clean the hallway and 3 bedrooms. On the phone I asked the receptionist about a deep clean for a spot the dogs had urinated on and she told me it would be 20 cents a square foot. I\"m talking the size of a beach towel. That's it. So I naturally thought I'll probably spend $20 more or so.\nThe man shows up in an unmarked white van. That doesn't seem very professional to me. I led him upstairs to the hallway and bedrooms. I'm alone in my house with a man as he is talking super fast in my bedroom, about how I need this added on: Deep clean, sanitizer, and scotchguard to get a 2 year warranty (where I'll only need to spend $70 to have this all done again) He also suggested doing the stairs at $2 a step which would be $60 for my steps.\nHe's talking so fast about what I need that I finally stopped and I said, \"Wait sir, what is my total at this point?\" He responded over $200+ and I said, \"I just can't do that.\" So he said, \"Ok, I'll throw this in for free, and do this...\" as he scratches the board. He goes downstairs and begins. \nHe told me the carpet would dry in 12-24 hours. It did not. More like 36-48. He also soaked my wooden floors near the front door and did not wipe up with a towel or even ask me for a towel. I am human. I know we make mistakes, but just ask me for a towel. I\"m also not writing a review over THAT. It gets worse.\nAfter he left and I looked over my bill, I noticed the numbers didn't add up, that my voucher was NOT subtracted from the total (it was added back in to the total) and that nothing made sense. Next to the \"total\" line it said $199. But if you add up the numbers in that particular column it totals $213. Then off to the left he has 2 other columns of numbers equaling 180, 190 with a 44 and $234 and $205. Could YOU make sense of this?!?!\nTHAT is why I wanted to speak to a manager. So, I started researching this company which I can't believe I didn't do in the first place because I research everything!!! That's when I knew I was in trouble. Including the reviews about what a prick the manager is. So I was prepared to be super nice in explaining my confusion!\nWhen I called the receptionist I told her I was confused about my bill and she simply told me the manager would call me back in 3 days.\nWhen we spoke,I honestly have never been talked to so badly in my life or so poorly mistreated by a company that has been in MY house and I paid a total of $234 to!\nFrom the moment the manager answered the phone, he was an a**. His words were slurred so bad I couldn't understand half of what he said unfortunately. I told him very politely I was calling him about a voucher I bought from Living Social for $39 and I didn't even get to explain I was confused about my bill. \nThe manager starts his rant about how basically he had no clue what my carpet looked like and how most people can't even get their carpet cleaned for that price and what a joke if they think they can! (umm...then why do you sell a voucher for $39 for a $79 deal stating we do???) He started his mocking, screaming, accusations at me immediately.  He then proceeds to mock me that I was upset about doing negotiations for the carpet in my bedroom, alone with a man and that is why I bought everything.\nThat is when I said, \"EXCUSE me sir, I NEVER said that and I am so appalled that I've not gotten in ONE word to explain why I've called (confusion over the bill) and all you have done is talk over me this entire time, slur your words...\"\nAnd that is when he started screaming, laughing, telling me, \"yep and this story is over, THE END.\"\nHe went on and on and on. I couldn't get in one word. He just laughed, mocked, screamed, and laughed some more. Horrible, distasteful man of a human being.","date":"2015-04-20 16:09:27"}

Last Saturday night my daughter and I were looking for a place near her apartment and we decided to give Roy-Pitz a try at long last. We could have walked the mile to Roy-Pitz, but I had my car and was able to find free parking right in front. Always a good omen.\n\nThis section of Spring Garden, as with some many other sections of the city, is really evolving. There are apartments opening up above Roy-Pitz and also across the street. Win-Win, Sazon, Bufad and Prohibition Tap Room are all close by and of course Union Transfer.\n\nRoy-Pitz is a really cool, unique and industrial space. It was larger then I expected with a lot seating at tables and also a good amount of bar seating. I ordered the Psychedelic Strawberry Ale - Barrel Aged Sour Belgian Strong Ale. This was very good and not too sour and it was strong as advertised. My daughter tried the cider. We of course had to try the Bavarian Soft Pretzel and that was huge and awesome. I preferred the mustard sauce over the cheese sauce. We also tried the Roasted Beet Salad, Barrel House Burger - 8oz short rib & brisket blend burger, gruyere, roasted beer onions, Zayda's sweet hot pickles, bacon, rosemary porter aioli and the Beer Battered Cod Sandwich Lettuce, tomato, onion, giardiniera aioli. Everything was very good and the menu is varied and eclectic for pub fare.\n\nFor dessert there were three items to choose from but the Pound Cake Bananas Foster with vanilla ice cream was the one we found most appealing. This was a very good dessert and more like a bread pudding. It was large enough to share for two people easily.\n\nThe atmosphere is great, our server was excellent. Both of us were so full so we walked around a little on Spring Garden. We will definitely be back to Roy-Pitz.","date":"2018-09-24 16:00:51"}

Egg was cooked well, everything was hot, hollandaise was as expected, portion was good for the price.\n\nService was okay. Ran out of water with no offer to refill at the end of the meal. Bathroom was clean and well-kept. \n\nAll in all a very nice place to eat but quite pricey.","date":"2022-01-04 16:17:32"}

It has such a great amazing amount of things for seriously EVERYONE. Vegetarian & vegan options galore. I personally have had the Italian hoagie (that spicy spread tho - noms), a charcuterie board, jerk spiced sweet potatoes with coconut rice (ummm, to die for), some kind of savory waffle jawn (we ordered the tomato pie but ended up getting served this but it was a beautiful mistake) & the spicy noodle soup- tasty but not something I would order again- just my own personal tastebuds. \n\nOur favorite drink is hands down the slow boil (basically their version of a hot toddy) especially during these cold nights. It's just super good and goes down very smooth- love the orange rind with the cloves in them. The old fashioned is good as well. \n\nThe ambiance is real chill- pretty dimly lit.

Every time I visit Austin I see the line and I'm always told that I should eat there so I was excited that one was opening in Nashville. It took me awhile to give it a shot, hamburgers aren't my favorite food so it takes awhile for me to crave one. We ended up here after church one night and it was pretty empty so we got in, ordered and got our food pretty quickly! First off, I love that they have Maine Root sodas, which I don't even drink soda very often, but those are some of the best! I got a bacon cheeseburger and my husband got the caesar salad and we split both. The burger was okay, it had a decent flavor, the bacon was burnt little pieces, which isn't my favorite but it's still bacon and i still happily ate it. The problem with the burger is that Nashville has a lot of burger places, so many that some burger places have shut down because there's so much competition so a burger has to be awesome or I'll just go to my favorite spot and this didn't beat it. The caesar salad was big, they don't offer a small side caesar salad and had a decent flavor. I think if I were vegan, this would be my go to spot since they have the impossible burger, but since I eat meat, I'll come here only when someone else really wants to go.","date":"2018-04-09 17:02:55"}

The menu has been updated with less options but I think that's fine as long as they actually have the items advertised. They were out of Sapporo so I had to get a lager on tap. Less of a big deal. They had karaage and it was fresh out of the fryer. Excellent although I found myself wishing for more of the sauce that came with it. As for the ramen I hate to say this but they still aren't firing on all cylinders yet. Ramen to broth ratio is improved but I want half a cup more broth in the bowl. Also there was more, uh, oil in this bowl and I'm not usually accustomed to quite so much. The egg made into the bowl but still is just barely turning into a hard boiled egg. Pork was more hefty so I have less of a complaint about that. Waitress tried hard to please, I think the negative reviews have had an effect.  Again, even the worst ramen restaurant is still pretty good and I'll stick by that assessment but bump it up to 3 stars. Hopefully they have fixed the problem with the gyoza which is quite truthfully unacceptable.\n\nI was there for lunch on opening day so the chaos was unsurprising. They covered up with tape the menu options that were not yet available but there were other items that weren't covered up and STILL weren't available. No booze because no liquor license yet but it was also on the menu uncovered. Waitress knew very little about the food. I've eaten ramen at good and middle of the road restaurants (menchanko-tei and ippudo in NYC, samurai and muto in Seattle) and the flavor of my shoyu was good, as was the tonkotsu my wife ordered. Noodles were consistent with what I've come to expect from every ramen restaurant I've been to.\n\nAside from the menu mistakes and service foibles, my biggest critique of Ramen Sho is what Horix has written: the noodle to broth ratio. That's a real but solvable problem, and it shouldn't be happening. I shouldn't have to press my spoon down into the noodles to get into the broth for heaven's sake.\n\nOther things: the low quality of pork belly. It looked like a few half slices of bacon were slid in there. My egg (which initially wasn't there, the waitress noticed and gave me a whole egg, nice touch!) was a little over cooked with the yolk starting to get chalky around the edges. Also these are fixable. I hear this place is super crowded now so they don't have an incentive to fix their problems... yet. Let's see if they fix them, or if they concentrate on raking in the dollars.\n\nAnd could they please please please put some tsukemono on the menu!","date":"2017-06-27 20:56:40"}

It is a really cool concept and a must when visiting Nashville!\n\nI had the pleasure of trying the bonuts, the lily, and the east nasty (without gravy for dietary reasons). The bonuts are fried biscuit dough topped with lemon mascarpone and served on top of blueberry compote. It's like a donut hole, but the best donut hole you'll ever have in your life! They are AMAZING and I loved that they weren't overly sweet. The blueberry compote provides a great touch; I definitely recommend getting it into every bite. The lily is biscuit french toast topped with lemon mascarpone, blueberry compote, and syrup. I think if it had been just the biscuit french toast with syrup, I would have loved it. They prepared the french toast very well, but the lemon marscapone made it too sweet. There was a bit too much going on for my preference, but I can't deny that it was tasty. The east nasty was pretty good as well and I imagine that it's much better with gravy. Unfortunately, I had to get it plain, but it's still a solid chicken biscuit.\n\nBe sure to check out Biscuit Love when you get the chance and do yourself a favor: ORDER THE BONUTS.

While in University I used to always be scared to come here as everyone said the prices were so high. I would walk by at night and see all the people inside and think, \"I wonder what it tastes like?\" Let me tell you - it tastes great! As for price, although their dinner menu seems a little high their lunch menu is just right. \n\nWe have been here a number of times and have always been pleased with our dishes. I tend to go for the Sawadee Combination which shows up under their appetizers. Don't be fooled! It is a lunch special that includes a small salad, appetizer and a half order of an entree. It is the perfect amount and you can have them surprise you or ask for your favourites from the menu. I always ask for the Poppy Shrimp as the appetizer. Lightly battered shrimp served with a curry mustard dipping sauce. It makes the meal! I let them choose the rest. Last time it was Pad Thai and a Mango Spinach salad. All for an amazing price. You can't go wrong. \n\nWe like it here so much that we recommended it for a friend's special celebration gathering. They had almost 30 people and only one out of the entire group didn't absolutely love what they had. They merely liked it. That's pretty good for a large group. Service was prompt and helpful.

Sometimes you can get fries that weren't fried enough or over fried. I've gotten mine under cooked more times than overcooked. Their pizza is better than all the fast food chains (Little Caesars, Dominos, etc) and not too greasy. Their wings are top notch. I only eat wings from here or Wingstop, depending on my mood. I only recently started going to Wingstop. Growing up, I only ate wings from here. They're that good. \n\nThis place is usually busy, so I suggest calling ahead to place your order and pick up. On average, the wait is 25-35 minutes. The atmosphere is busy. I wouldn't come here if I wanted to relax. There are usually lots of families with loud kids or groups of friends eating here so in general, the place is loud.

When I received a 24 ounce container of macaroni and cheese, I immediately called the restaurant and spoke with a manager who apologized and told me to come in for the replacement. I went to the Golden Corral this evening to get some dinner to go from the line. When I went up front to pay for my food, I told the cashier about what happened with the macaroni salad, and showed her my order on the Door Dash app. The cashier was new, but kind, and she quickly went and got the manager (Joe). \n\nWhen the manager walked up, I started to tell him the story and he immediately became defensive and confrontational. First, he interrupted me and said, do you know the managers name. Then he interrupted me and said they don't sell macaroni salad there, as if he thought I was lying about the entire thing. Then he told me that I need to contact Door Dash because they do not handle any Door Dash issues in store. I continuously tried to explain that the manager of their restaurant never told me they didn't even sell macaroni salad and he asked me to come in, which is why I was there. Finally, he became frustrated and said, even if we sold macaroni salad, I would give it to you. I became upset, because I felt like he wasn't listening to anything I was saying and he came to the conclusion that I was some liar or cheat who was looking for free food. I then said to him that he was being disrespectful to me and that I did not even know if I wanted the food I had in front of me at the register. He then said, \"If you take the food without paying for it I will call the police and you will be arrested for theft. I then said, I already paid for my food, I was referring to getting a refund. He then said, I can make that happen. We started going back and forth about his threat. Then I asked the cashier to call Joe's manager. \n\nWhile I was waiting for Joe's manager, another customer walked up to Joe and said that he had been waiting for over 20 minutes for Joe's manager to come to his table because he received raw meet. Joe turned to him and said, \"well, he's busy.\" The customer then said, \"he's too busy to speak to a paying customer about an issue.\" The customer was standing the proof on his plate in his hand. Joe then told him that if he did not calm down he would call the police and have him arrested. The customer increasingly became upset because of the unwarranted threat, then Jose came out and calmed the customer down. The customer was still upset. He continued to yell at Joe as he made his way to the door. He said, \"whats your problem? You need to learn how to talk to customers. Your'e not supposed to treat customers like this.\" Jose then walked up to speak with me. I explained the matter to him, and he immediately apologized. He told me that they no longer sell macaroni salad, and if I reach out to Door Dash they should resolve the issue. He basically said the same thing that Joe said, but with respect and sincerity. I then explained to Jose that Joe is rude and disrespectful and he does not know how to treat customers. I am a business major who has extensive restaurant experience, and I have never seen or dealt with a person like Joe. I felt offended by how Joe treated me. I felt the need to log in to my bank account to show Jose that I have a substantial amount of money, and that I was not looking to con anyone out of macaroni salad. Jose told me he believed me. \n\nJoe took a small issue and made it worse. Joe is emotionally unstable, he lacks customer service skills, but most importantly, he lacks people skills. He does not know how to effectively handle conflict, and he is actually skilled in escalating matters, not deescalating them. Joe is a liability and he visibly makes Jose's job harder. Jose had to calm both myself and the other customer down after Joe's failed attempt of resolving basic issues.

The gulf shrimp was tender and fresh, smoked sausage was high-quality and you definitely can taste all the meats in it. The cheery tomatoes was a good addition, change of flavors from the acidity. Lastly, the ground grits was soaked in a nice broth. Very well-cooked and super delicious. I just wish there was something crunchy to change up the texture of this dish, because overall it was a mushy and soft dish, but taste-wise it was amazing. \n\n- Double Cut Pork Chop [GET]: Fire-grilled pork chop with creole spices paired with greens. The highlight was the smothered new potatoes. It was wonderful, literally perfectly cooked, cannot ask for better potatoes. It was packed with flavors and spices, definitely one of my favorite thing of the night. The blueberry pork jus also elevates the potatoes and the pork chops a lot. The jus was sweet and pork chop was salty, I love the combination. Only downside is that pork chop was a bit well-done when we ask for it to be cooked medium. \n\n- Mississippi Rabbit Fricassee [GET]: This is braised local rabbit seared trinity topped with Louisiana popcorn rice. The rabbit had the texture of a chicken thigh, but with more or almost only lean meat. It was well-cooked and definitely juicy, loved the sauce with it (wonderful NOLA base). Make sure to soak the rice and the blackened sweet cornbread into the sauce; made it a bit easier to eat, otherwise it would be too dry. Overall, it was incredible. \n\n- Loa Sangria [SKIP]: Got the sangria with fresh apple, pear, orange, and spices soaked in red wine. I was not a big fan of the sangria, wasn't sweet or able to taste the fruits. It was a weird combination with the spices. I think the red wine wasn't strong enough either. Would not recommend, just go for the cocktails. \n\nAmbiance: 4.75\/5 - I love the atmosphere here, because everyone seems so so happy here. It is in the Garden District of NOLA, full of amazing restaurants and shops in the area. We sat at the balcony, and the weather is perfect for outdoor seating, and there's amazing Christmas songs playing, super festival vibe. The decorations is super chic. The bathroom is huge, with a couch in it. This is the perfect spot for a date night. \n\nPrice: 4\/5 - The sangria was $9, and we got an appetizer for $14. We ordered three entrees: shrimp & gris-gris- grits, double cut pork chop, and rabbit fricassee for $26, $28, and $27, respectively. The total came up to be around $130 after taxes and tips for the three of us. \n\nService: 4.5\/5 - I made a reservation on Resy, and got seated as soon as we arrived. The service was outstanding and friendly, especially our server. She was quick and efficient. Gave us great recommendations and was super patient with us, and also warned us about the kitchen being backed up. The food did take a while though, but she kept us company by constantly checking in with us. Great experience for sure, many laughters with my siblings. \n\nBLUF: Refined Southern cuisine owned by Chef Eric Cook (a great look guy, and make sure to read his profile on their website). An unbelievably experience, excellent twist on Southern food, cool decor, and wonderful service. This is a not to miss place in NOLA. I recommend the Shrimp & Gris-Gris Grits and the Mississippi Rabbit Fricassee.","date":"2022-01-03 23:13:35"}

I was informed that Alpen Rose offers  a unique, and unforgettable dining experience; if one is capable of securing a reservation, which is the reason why I stalked OpenTable all day Friday, to secure a 5:30 dinner reservation the next day. It was no easy task as this place is booked solid for months. \n\nThe interesting and unique begins at the door upon arrival. Patrons ring the doorbell for entry and then they are greeted by a hostess through a panel on the door to confirm your reservation before being allowed to enter. I unfortunately did not get the opportunity to experience this prohibition style entry as previous diners were leaving the restaurant, and I walked in with my friend to join the other half our party.\n\nUpon seating we were greeted by an awesome waiter who was more than happy to explain the concept behind the restaurant, made great suggestions, and made everything on the menu sound heavenly. Service kicked off with an amazing round of cocktails of their prohibition style drink menu; numbers only. We moved on to appetizers including 1\/2 dozen of Japanese style oysters and bone-marrow toast. This was my first time sampling bone-marrow. I didn't think it was horrible, but I probably should have ordered more oysters. \n\nIt was now time for the entree portion of our dining experience. My wife and I decided to go with a special our waiter sold us on, a over 40 day dry-aged Porterhouse for two. Based upon our experiences at other steakhouses this was not quite what we expected in regards to portion size. I could have eaten the porterhouse on my own. In regards to flavor, this quality cut of meat had a rich flavor that just melted in your mouth. My friend is a lobster lover, and orders it every time we dine out. She enjoyed it but it left her feeling a bit underwhelmed. The accompaniments were spot on; especially the roasted carrots...they were absolutely fantastic. The mashed potatoes... creamy and delicious! Onion Rings...creamy and delicious! \n\nWe usually get dessert at another location but we planned on ordering the baked alaska before we even set foot inside the restaurant and it did not disappoint; in presentation or taste. We also ordered the chocolate cake. No disrespect to the prominent dessert at this establishment but the chocolate cake stole the show. We also ordered coffee with dessert. Okay it's coffee but, the entire set up with the French press, coffee cups, saucers, and sugar cubes had Alpen Rose style written all over it. \n\nI have already been stalking OpenTable for reservations for my birthday in a couple of weeks but there are is no availability, in addition to no baby sitter. This experience has me wanting experience the quality this establishment has to offer again.","date":"2020-01-06 05:20:13"}

I love the rich Greek culture and the history behind this area. The Greeks setup shop here back in the day and made a living by diving for sponge! \n\nThe sponge is a live organism but they once they bring it up to land, they dry it and sanitize it to use as a bathing tool. I've actually went on a boat tour with a sponge diver and man, seeing what they did for a living was thrilling and inspiring. It's not easy work and the diving suit is super heavy with pretty much a hose feeding the suit with oxygen. The bottoms of their boots are lined with weights so they can walk down at the bottom of the sea and collect the sponges. It was a booming industry back in the early 1900's but not so much today since synthetic sponges are made in place of the live sponges.\n\nThere's quite a few restaurants and shops on Dodecanese Avenue; I've been to a couple of the restaurants and the food was excellent. The shops are pretty neat; I've bought a few souvenirs and soaps made from goat milk from them.

The first was a charity dinner with many people paying over $100, some of which went to charity.  The second was a corporate function with each head costing $75 or so.\n\nYou should know that Carriage House has a banquet kitchen that can keep things cold, hot, or reheat them.  It is not a full restaurant kitchen!  The food is prepared next door at chef Wilder's real restaurant.\n\nAt the first event the air-conditioning was undersized or some units were not on.  The staff kept lowering the thermostat setting, unaware that when the unit can't 'satisfy' the requested temperature, lowering it more does nothing other than annoy those of us who see you doing nothing useful.\n\nAt the second event the room was still a bit warm but the staff did not turn the air-conditioning units on at all.  The tables had been arranged in a pattern I can't really describe... it's like they threw out frisbees into this large room (and it IS a large room) and there they landed they put out an eight-top.  \n\nThe dishes were brought out by banquet servers, not professional restaurant servers.  ONE dish per hand, usually on both hands.  That's right, no stacking of dishes, only serving two customers per trip back to the banquet (think \"keeping warm and reheating\") kitchen.  The service order was random.  At one point the ladies were served first --  this is correct.  At another point the dishes were brought out and one side of the table was served first, ladies and gentlemen, and at another all but one of us were served and then the server went off to other tables.\n\nNeither the plates (nor the table) had any form of sauce, dressing, or condiment.  The meat was free from sauce, etc.  There were two different fish dishes but not more than a dab of sauce underneath. There was no bread nor was there butter.   We can all avoid the carbs, but that should be our choice.\n\nThe food, being reheated was lukewarm, prepared all to the same temperature (\"medium+\"), and of no significant quality that stood out.  The fish appeared to have come from a frozen batch, evident since all the orders were the same size, shape, and consistency.  Unless you're running your own fish processing plant you'd never get this uniformity... unless... you bought frozen.  \n\nNow with all that over two dinners you might ask well why did we come back a second time, and why not leave.  The servers.  Their attitude was remarkably cool, calm, and professional.  While they only carried two plates at a time, they didn't drop them.  They delivered the right food to the right people.  They kept waters filled (chef Wilder doesn't provide bussers at these events) and plates cleared and were as prompt as they could be given the two-plate at a time constraint.  They smiled, they engaged in conversation, and when one of our guests said she couldn't eat the [I forget what] they found her a substitute asap.\n\nMy recommendations:\n1. Don't go in the heat of summer.  The cooling system is inadequate and cannot keep up.  \n2. When you preorder your food or order your food remember it's not \"made on site\" so use the same criteria as if you'd  order something delivered from a restaurant with a 40 minute delivery time.  Fried foods will be soggy.  Saucy foods may have the sauce separate or get sopped up by other foods.\n3. Expect to wait a long time.  Be patient.  If that's not what you're thinking that night, don't go.\n\nE","date":"2019-03-02 03:28:53"}

This is all in a packed space of roughly 700-800 sq ft.\n\nI was SO excited to try it in hope that I could get some authentic Greek-American food, some good feta (stored in water in many greek groceries), and maybe some Italian imports. \n\nI love ALL things Mediterranean, especially greek, between growing up with a lot of Greeks in Queens + a few visits to Greece, my authenticity meter is pretty on point. No Italian imports but recognized some greek ones and feta in water. I ordered 1 gyro pita (delish w\/ fresh pita), 1 greek salad (w\/ that goood feta), 1 spanakopita (YAS - authentic and even good room temp), and baklava (man, this was good too - walnuts and pastry were fresh w\/ right amt. of honey).  \n\nSo, why 2 stars?  Let me tell you why.  \n\nBecause there is a sign on the door that says masks are required (SEE PIC) but NONE of the staff were wearing masks (1\/3 had a face shield) and 7\/9 patrons (assuming the 7 were regulars or perhaps some family because most were going in\/out of back door).  There was no social distancing. There was even a greek orthodox priest that entered at the same time as me (wearing a bandana as a mask) but actually pulled it down over his chin after entering?!  Folks, including 2 elderly women were walking around, maskless, yapping across the store and one was coughing up a lung. I really thought I was on candid camera for a minute. \n\nI said I would wait outside given the lack of masks and when I went back in, 1 of the patrons + priest were wearing masks.  I picked up my food (quickly) and said how excited I was to try this place but was concerned that there was a sign on the door about masks that wasn't being followed.  The employee (face-shield) just sort of gave me a grunt and one of the elderly patrons, still maskless and now sitting, sort of heckled me, as I walked out and said she was eventually going to eat. \n\nUltimately, if a business doesn't require masks, patrons can choose whether or not to visit that establishment, but when you mislead patrons, by putting a sign on the door saying that you require masks, and then do not follow or enforce it, that is not only negligent but deceiving. Be better.","date":"2021-01-25 05:26:04"}

Seriously we keep talking about it so i had to write it up!  We live in Atlanta with plenty of good restaurants but Margot is a unique must-go that seems like the original place that a lot of new restaurants are trying to copy. \nWe had an 8 o'clock reservation on a friday night, and it seemed pretty busy but the place isn't very big so hard to tell.  Almost right away our table was ready and we sat upstairs at a small table for two right next to the rail overlooking the bar. Even though it was small and there was another table close to us we loved it. It felt kind of like a bistro in Paris, small and crowded but in a good way. The server was wonderful. A tall, tattoed guy named Adam(ask for him). Maybe I've just never had good service in a restaurant, but this guy could not have been better. He was funny and helpful and gave us the perfect recomendations for food and wine. My wife was ready to leave me for this guy! So anyways, now that I know what good service is like, on to the food. Adam asked if we had been there before, we said no, he offered to tell us a little about the menu.  The menu changes every day, and he quickly went over the basics of it. He pointed out the marinated olives and said he liked them, so we got some and my word, they were great.  Naturally we asked him what was good and what we should order. The lamb and the seafood were the top picks for the night, but he also mentioned the steak because it was from some special cow and very good. My wife asked about the chicken and (we loved this) he said something like \"well, its chicken, but it is the best chicken I've ever had, so if thats what you want, get it\" and it was really good. I had lamb, and it was also great. We were too full for dessert, and i regret not getting something. We live around lots of supposedly good restaurants, but Margot is something else.

Shortly after the system was installed it couldn't live up to the standards the salesman guaranteed it would. \n\nMultiple different technicians and a service manager have been out to troubleshoot the system, all with different theories and solutions that should have fixed the AC, but nothing has worked. Right Now is unwilling to stand behind the stated performance expectations boasted by their salesman and is in direct violation of their advertised \"100% Client Satisfaction Guarantee\". \n\nI have had 2 independent HVAC companies assess the AC system that was sold to me by Right Now and both of them said they would have never increased the size of my AC to 2.5 tons without replacing my existing 2 ton furnace with a bigger one. I also have a written quote to duplicate the work Right Now did and it came to $1,300 less than what Right Now charged me and they refused to honor the price match guarantee because \"it doesn't make much business sense\". \n\nThey offered to rig my furnace with a new blower motor to increase the airflow, but I would have to sign a waiver that would give up my right to the satisfaction guarantee. That is the most devious business practice I have ever witnessed. The owner should be embarrassed that was even offered to a customer. \n\nThe moral of the story is the salesman sold me something he shouldn't have and did it using the satisfaction guarantee they advertise everywhere on their website, and the company is not standing behind that guarantee. Instead of fixing the problem they created in the right way, they insist on trying to blow me off or rig my system just enough to make me forget about the real problem, which is airflow from the now undersized furnace! \n\nHere's the crazy part: They even exacerbated the airflow deficiency they created by telling me I had to purchase 2 new duct supplies for over $1000. Adding more ductwork without adding airflow takes away airflow from the existing ducts. The purchase was completely unnecessary but I was told it was mandatory.\n\nI'm completely unsatisfied, and Right Now is refusing to honor their money back guarantee or fix the problem. I have requested to escalate my issue to the owner. I was told \"I'll pass it on\" but haven't heard anything from the company. If I can't get a response in a timely manner I will further advance my complaint to the BBB and small claims court.\n\nI have never seen a company with such disregard for its customers after the sale, which demonstrates their true intention. I've seen your comments Jeff, so I know you're reading this. It's unfortunate that Yelp reviews are a more effective way to communicate with the owner about a problem with his business than a phone call. Call me and make this right!","date":"2019-07-27 01:53:59"}

I really liked that they have vegan options as well as a menu that allows guests to create their own menu inspiration  My wife ordered the chicken kabob with rice and I ordered the stuffed grape leaves, dolma, and hummus as well as the Za'atr  bread.  The staff member who took our order was so patient with us and really helped us navigate the menu and choices.  We were not sure if we would be able to dine in but after confirming with the staff, we were able to have a date night inside a restaurant. Another staff member stopped by and let us know that the kabob would be prepared to order with a 15 minute wait time. It was not an issue as it allowed us to spend more of our date night in a restaurant together.  NOTE:  At this time, about a month ago or so, we wore our masks until our order arrived, and when our order arrived and shortly after our server left, we carefully removed and stored our masks to begin eating.   All of the dishes arrived and they were stunningly presented.  The chicken kabob over the bed of rice in the bowl was aromatically pleasing and the rolled \/ stuffed grape leaves were perfectly presented.  The hummus was freshly made and the Za'atr bread was the most mysterious.  I went for the Za'atr bread first as it really intrigued me.  The spices were an overload but not in a bad way, just in a new way.  It was sparks and fireworks in my mouth all at the same time.  Crazy and ridiculously tasty.  The hummus was just right.  It was not overly lemony but it was not dry and the pita bread was warm and crisp but not burnt.  The rolled grape leaves aka Dolma were sticky sweet on the outside and stuffed with spices and flavors inside.  They were my absolute favorite of everything we tried.  My wife really like her kabab and rice.  The charred cubes of chicken and onions were just right.  \n\nThroughout our meal, multiple staff came over to check on us and visit.  \n\nAfterwards we each had some Turkish coffee and some baklava.  The coffee is out of world experience.  There's chicory and other spices.  It's strong to be sure but the perfect after dinner drink.   My wife gently savored the baklava and commented on its sweet sticky notes with its crunchy pastry crisps. \n\n\nIt was a date night to remember and we're looking forward to coming back soon. Thank you Team Mazzah. \n\nGörüşürüz!","date":"2021-05-22 21:47:24"}

If you're not in the mood to drive 20-30+ minutes across the river to Philly Chinatown, Sang Kee is your next best thing.\n\nThey were smart to open in Cherry Hill, and the location is great, but the layout of their restaurant was not so great. When you enter, there is a small area for tables, and as you walk further in, there are seats around a sushi bar and a narrow hallway in the back leading to the bathrooms. Sang Kee's focus and specialty is Chinese food, not sushi. Why would you have a huge sushi bar that takes up valuable space for dining tables?\n\nAlthough the floor plan of the restaurant was well thought out, the decor is nice. It is classier than most Chinese restaurants with dark wooden tables and simplistic, modern wall sconces that keep the restaurant well lit.\n\nThe last time I went, I ordered the wonton noodle soup and added beef tendon for pick-up. There is an equal balance of fatty beef tendons and actual lean meat. The wontons had a nice thin skin\/wrapper (like they should), and the stuffing was pleasant with the taste of shrimp. If you simply order the wonton noodle soup, it is $8, but the addition of the beef tendon is $2. Ouch! We also had the stir fried flat noodles with beef and Singapore rice noodles. All of the dishes were as they should be. No complaints.\n\nI commend the food for not being Americanized. A rule of thumb for Chinese restaurants: if you see lots of Chinese people, that means it's good, and it's legit Chinese food. When I went, my mom and I bumped into at least 3 other families from my old Chinese school. However, the prices are steep -- if they were located in New York City, then I would understand, but we're talking about Cherry Hill here.","date":"2012-03-22 06:48:21"}

I said I also understood if pickup time had to be moved back due to my last minute order and they said no, come at 11am. My mom just showed up and they told her infront of the busy store, that she had no flowers. She was upset and called me, as I am at work and paid $40 for them to be ready by then. I had to take time away from my work day, to show them that she did have a pickup and once she went back in and showed them that I talked to someone on the phone this morning and my order, it magically appeared and they weren't nice about it but extremely rude.

I called the Pinellas County Sheriff's department at 1452 to locate my vehicle.  The sheriff's department had no record at this time of who the towing company was that picked up my vehicle. They sent a deputy out just to make sure everything was ok. My friend called her HOA whom let her know the tow company is Black Jack towing as they do not allow parking on the street. (But 15 minutes come on, this tow comany was trolling the neighborhood) Once finding out the towing company and calling to find out where it was towed (that it is an 18 minute drive to pick up my car) and that it is going to be $130. My purse with my wallet and license and my ID badge for work is in my car. And to mention i was just at the store with $83 of perishable groceries in my car. I am a Critical Care Nurse and must report for duty with my badge and on time and was a must i get my car back asap. Upon arrival to get my car, i pulled out my credit card, at which time they stated its cash ONLY. It was 1702 the banks were closed and i did not have a debit card. They did not reference paying cash at anytime. Lucky the my friend had $150 in cash. Then they tell me they dont give change.  Meanwhile I have my younger 8 yearold daughter standing in the hot sun.

Love their spicy tonkatsu ramen and their takoyaki. \n\nWell, Recently I tried something else from their menu out of my usual ramen. \nI ordered the tan tan ramen and it came so beautifully bright yellowish with red chili color from the ground pork. I tested the broth and I tested little bit salty. But hey it was deliciously good, so I kept eating it and finally after few bites I realized this tan tan ramen was way too salty. I told the server and she told me that other customers also said the same, and  tan tan is quite like that. I was amazed, thinking why they keep this menu then? I think it wasn't the broth that too salty, it was the ground pork made the broth also became salty. I don't dare to order it again because it will be a waste of money. Well I hope they can cut a bit of salt for this one. \nThe noodles always cooked great. \n\nI also love their fried rice. It was so delicious. The kimchi one was the best. The spicyness was perfect, the pork also so good. The other ijji fried rice also delicious. Chicken, shrimp were cooked perfect. \nThe appetizer, I tried takoyaki, chicken karage and wings and all of them are yummy but their takoyaki is the bomb. \n\nThe bulgogi bowl was okay. Too many veggies for my taste. The pho number 1 combination also good stuff. The broth was rich flavorful and the meat cuts were nice. \nI need to try their other menu from the Vietnamese menu section.\nService from the guy was always great and friendly. \nSorry no photos, and hopefully my review won't goes to not recommended folder because no photos hehehe, next time will take some photos","date":"2021-12-06 03:37:21"}

I was really excited to try Drybar for the first time and had an important weekend and wanted to look my best. When I arrived both the front desk girl and my stylist were very nice and accommodating however I could tell right away that my stylist looked exhausted. She proceeded to tell me how her young son had kept her up the night before and she did not get any sleep. Now I do not have children and I am sure it is not an easy job at all but I do not really believe that is an appropriate thing to say to a customer especially when you are about to style their hair. \n\nI explained that I was looking for a straight look with a lot of volume. I told the stylist that my hair is very fine especially at the crown and that a lot of product will weigh it down. Also I told her I was going away for the weekend and needed the blow out to last at least three days to which she said would not be a problem. As soon I sat in the chair she started pouring product onto my roots, now I am not a hairdresser but even I know that when someone tells you they have fine hair you should never put any heavy styling product on their roots!! I I again reminded her that I wanted a lot of volume and even suggested her putting rollers on my crown, she didn't. She proceeds to start blow drying my hair, yawning the entire time and telling the other stylists and myself how tired she was and again how she did not get any sleep the night before. Ok if you are that tired go around the corner to Starbucks! Don't complain if front of your customer and not pay attention to a word they say. She stops in the middle and asks if the curls at the end are enough or too much?? I told her that in the beginning I had said I did not want any curl just straight with a lot of volume. She told me she was sorry and said she should have asked in the beginning how much curl I wanted....ummmm I told you no curl! She then started putting more product in my hair which I assume was to straighten out the curl. By the time she was \"finished\" there was no curl however my hair looked like I had not washed it in four days! I kept asking her to try and put more volume  in the top because it was basically flat to my head at this point. She said she did the best she could and suggested I get a haircut since that was obviously the issue not all the product she put on my roots. \n\nWhen I got up to the front desk and looked in the mirror I was almost in tears. I told the front desk girl that I was not happy with my result and that my hair looked dirty and un-styled. She told me she thought it looked \"ok\" but could she my point and would fix it if I wanted. Wait a minute why would you ever let a customer leave when you know they do not look their best or more so when you know their hair does not look good??? I asked her to please try and fix what she could since I was running late already and would be gone all weekend.\n\nWhen I sat back down in the chair I felt my hair and again almost cried. It felt awful! All the product made it feel sticky and dirty. The front desk girl did her best to try and fix my hair but it really was no use. I wanted to just wash everything out and start over, which I did the next day,  because I could have done a much better job myself. I am so disappointed with my experience and the fact I spent so much money to only have my blow-out last one day before I could take it anymore and washed it all out.","date":"2016-11-21 14:55:44"}

I checked the reviews after the reservation was made and braced myself for what seemed to be an inevitably disappointing stay.

Not the sad kind of hotel bar that no one goes to, but one that was alive with people having a good time.  We checked in late, and I was immediately hit over the head by the hospitality of the staff.   Ok, dare I get my hopes up about this place? Our room was comfortable, modern, and clean.  I was pleasantly surprised that they had a charger with various adapters so you could pretty much charge anything.   And then there's the obvious perk of this hotel. Location, location, location.  It's prime to downtown Nashville.  Minutes from several cool parts of town and very walkable to any downtown spot.  You can't beat it.  \n\nThe only con reared it's ugly head, a couple of times actually, in the middle of the night.  Long after I had fallen asleep, a couple of parties finding their hotel rooms weren't quiet.  And why should they be, this isn't a library.  The walls seem pretty thin.  I didn't notice it nearly as badly as others have noted, but I was awoken a couple of times in the night.  No biggie.  That's hotel life, right?!  I would easily stay here again.

I have never sold to a Plato's Closet before and wanted to try to get rid of some items that I no longer wear. Some of the items were older, however no holes, or stains on these items. However, some of the items were brand new and others had only been worn 1-2 times; all from name brand stores. I was disappointed in the fact that none of my items were sold, however, I was even more disappointed in the level of customer service I received from the young lady that helped me. I went to the store on a Wednesday evening, when there just happened to be no customers in the store. \n\nFrom what I could tell, there were approximately 4 young ladies working in the store, one was on the phone when I walked in. I was carrying a rather large box that had all of my items, and as I walked in, the young lady that ended up helping me yelled across the store, \"Are you selling items today?\" When I replied \"Yes.\" She continued to yell something that I didn't understand. I walked up to the counter where I thought she had beckoned me with words, and placed my items down. As I stood there, she said to me (still having not moved from her original location) \"I'm going to have you go ahead and fill out some information on the computer.\" I continued to stand there and wait for direction, and she said again, \"I need you to fill out some information on the computer.\" When I asked \"Where?\" she pointed and said \"On the computer over there.\" As I looked around for a computer, I asked her, \"I'm sorry, where?\" She stated again, \"On the computer, and pointed.\" \"Where?\" I again asked. At this time, the other young lady that she had been conversing with when I entered the store, stated \"The IPad over there.\" Ah, now I understand. After filling out the requested information, while she was going through my items, I walked over to her, and she told me that it would be about 10 minutes while they went through my items, while she taped up my large box of items, and that I could shop around. Literally, 30 seconds later, she said \"I'm all done, and unfortunately, everything has too much wear.\" I thanked her, gathered up my items and left. \n\nThe level of customer service I received was extremely disappointing. Given the fact that I was the only customer in the store, and I clearly wasn't sure of what the process was, I thought I would have received a little more assistance. As I was once a young worker, I understand that it was a large inconvenience for this young lady to stop her conversation with her workmate when I entered the store; I find the experience extremely disappointing to the fact that it took so many times for any other workers to join in to assist, when I clearly was not able to communicate with the other worker. \n\nMy first and last experience at this place of business was an extremely poor one. I hope the store manager is able to use this as a coaching situation for how one ill experience can taint a potential seller and customer.","date":"2016-04-13 23:35:57"}

We were looking for the Toffee To Go pop up shop and just happened to find this new café. We had just had lunch, but wanted some coffee and a small bite of something sweet. This was perfect for what we wanted.\n\nSo, here's the story. This is there second location. The original location is in Port Richey where they make all of their Italian cookies and pastries. It's family owned. Their coffee is imported from Italy. They sell other imported items as well. They have this new espresso machine that came from Italy. I just couldn't pass up having a well-made cappuccino. \n\nWe both started with a cup of cappuccino. It was piping hot & frothy. Just like a cappuccino should be. I could definitely taste that this was not your typical Americanized coffee. It was a very good roast. Nice & strong, and creamy. I would definitely order this again when in Hyde Park. I was also very happy with there chocolate\/walnut flourless cookie. I can't remember the Italian name for it, but it was chewy & chocolaty (not too sweet). Just like the real thing. I think it's made with merengue, but I'm not totally sure. Mom and I also shared one of the homemade biscotti. It was soft enough to split in half, and was perfect for dunking into the coffee preparation.\n\nWe'll have to go back to try more items. They had various NY style cheesecakes, and cakes as well. For now, I recommend it for coffee and a quick bite of something sweet. Will update my review on my next visit.","date":"2018-12-08 14:52:42"}

It has taken that long to attempt to get the order correct with no avail because I'm still missing cabinets. \n\nIt started with a highly incompetent designer, who had no clue what he was doing. After many explanations on my end of how the kitchen should be designed we all agreed on the design. After my client and I signed off and approved the design the cabinets were ordered. However, they decided that we didn't need 3 of the cabinets that were part of the design. So began our nightmare. \nI had to approach my customer and let them know that the original quote we had already paid for was incorrect by over $1500 Because of the cabinets they missed so as a courtesy I paid for half of that mistake, which was not mine to begin with. \nThen, when we finally received the first order one of the boxes was completely destroyed, so bad so that there was absolutely no doubt the cabinet itself would be destroyed. Well, the representative that I spoke with to file the claim asked me to take out the cabinet and take fotos, as if I had the time to do all that, as if the destroyed packaging wasn't enough for them. Not to mention that I absolutely was not accepting the box in that condition. It should have suffice for me to say I'm not accepting it, and good business practice is to send a new one. \nThrough all this, we are still missing 3 cabinets they finally are shipped BUT to the wrong house. When I told them I didn't received the cabinets they called UPS and had them ship the cabinets back to the manufacturer in OHIO!! So 4 weeks later I'm STILL waiting for these cabinets which are holding over $50k of my income up because I can't complete the job. \nTheir customer service is awful to say the least. Nobody seems to even have a clue where they're standing when you call; and it seems like they've all learned the same script to convey to theirs than pleased customers because the way they run their business I'm sure the only customers they do have are very unhappy! \n\nI don't understand how companies like this stay in business..","date":"2020-10-19 20:14:00"}

I like that you could choose between a table or sitting at the sushi bar. The service was somewhat lackluster. I don't know if they were having a bad day, but our server was grumpy and off-putting. We ordered some hot sake, nigiri sushi, an eel roll, tempura appetizer and beef udon noodles. \n\nThe sake and sushi (roll and nigiri) arrived after 5-10 mins and were tasty. I got the octopus and they gave generous portions. After that it took an additional 25-30 mins for the tempura and udon to arrive. And there was a strange burning smell coming from the kitchen.\n\nThe server apologized and told us the wait was because they were so busy, but the place was half empty.

We explained this to our server and said our daughter wasn't going to eat the watery Alfredo and asked for it to be taken off the ticket. We showed her that you could literally stir the sauce like it was milk.  This is when the server developed an attitude. Instead of being apologetic and asking if our daughter wanted something else or offering to get her another one she took the plate and became extremely standoffish. She could clearly see that the food was not right but somehow offended that we returned it. We went on to order cheesecake to go and she continued to have an attitude.

The key draw for me here was seeing them on Diners Drive-ins and Dives on Food Network and they really seemed to be a hometown kind of place.  When we arrived nearby we were not sure whether we wanted to stick around because there was a tremendous amount of less than desirable folks wandering around, which made it a bit uncomfortable.  We decided to take our chances and park anyway.  When we walked up, we noticed a fairly substantial outdoor space with a fair number of people indulging in some tasty looking beer and the food looked to be not only plentiful, but also seemed to be making everyone happy that was eating it.  \n\nWe went inside and were greeted right away; waiting on a few minutes for a table for four.  Once seated, our waiter was eager to answer any of our questions and bring up a couple of small samples before we decided on some local craft beers.  We ordered straight from the TV show since Guy Fieri though the dishes were noteworthy.  My \"moose killer meatloaf\" was really an amazing dish. which was a generous portion wrapped in bacon (who could go wrong with that), and a mushroom gravy and deep fried onions on top.  I have to say that the smell was absolutely amazing as it was presented to me.  My wife had a \"bomb\" burger which was another DDD item.  This was a nicely prepared burger that was wrapped in pizza dough and baked.  I'm not sure if I liked it nearly as much as my meatloaf, but the concept was pretty cool.  The kids had some house made root beer and the server was pretty generous with the pours so that made the kids happy.\n\nI would return here again, but if the neighborhood was a bit less shady, it would make the experience all that much more desirable.","date":"2014-12-10 00:41:44"}

We thought we were a little pressed for time as we were attending an event at The Franklin Theater (or is it Theatre?) Anyway our original intention was to go to The Cheesecake Factory. I was hoping Kaley Cuoco would be our waitress, but....\n\nMy wife works a little south of of 96 and Cool Springs is north of town and it was rush hour, Christmas season, growling stomachs that could not wait so here we are. Walked right, sit right down, baby let your mind roll on - sorry - it had to come out. There was a little concern about the server as he did not seem too into the job, but turns out he was actually good. The one thing he didn't do was mention the \"Blackboard Specials\". We were sat in the bar area which was fine as there was no one else there for a while and the TV's were muted. After we had almost finished I look over the half wall and see about half of the aforementioned blackboard. I would have made a better choice had I seen it. As it were I got the pot roast and as another reviewer mention it was unlike any pot roast I have had. WAY to salty and to me it looked like shredded BBQ without the smoke and without the flavor and without the low price. The mashed potatoes were good as was the gravy. The glazed carrots were too sweet, but not bad. My wife ordered the beef medallions which were cooked in garlic - a lot of garlic. It completely overpowered the meat flavor plus they were overcooked and a little tough. A baked potato subbed for mashed was a one dollar upcharge. She also got the spinach which was good - not Demos' good, but good.\n\nAfter tip for this underwhelming meal, decent slice of cheesecake and a glass of wine the total was almost $50. Yeah - and did I mention it was our anniversary? When we got to the theater and got our tickets it turns out it did not start until 7:30 - I COULDA HAD CHICKEN MADERIA AFTER ALL!

He created needle formations that embedded pigment with much less trauma to the skin, and he was one of the first to utilize single-use needles and hospital-quality sterilization.

I like what I like, so I don't really love guided tours in museums - but I want to know what I'm looking at (hence the 4 stars) particularly due to the nature of the Barnes collection. \nThe only reference for any of the art is available solely on these laminated cards stored inside the benches in each room. And they copied the original layouts of the room and Barnes wall ensembles, so there'll never be any real 'signage' but you need to do better.  \nEither create the world's most robust app (current app - very meh) to remain unobtrusive so people know what they're looking at, OR print a robust, worthwhile museum guide for visitors to carry on their journey and take home with them. \n\nBecause (confusion aside) the collection itself is very cool. \nPieces aren't here because they're works by famous artists -- they're here because of what Barnes himself saw in each piece. The man had boots on the ground in Europe, seeking out art himself, and amassed the collection on his own. Other museums existed during this time but no one else had someone there like Barnes himself was, learning more about the art, tracking pieces down and really seeing the value in some of the most popular styles of art now before anyone else did.\n\nMore helpful details: There is coat & bag check in the basement (as well as lockers) along with a small but decent gift shop.

They had great ideas, but the execution as a whole fell short due to a pattern of inconsistency. \n\nMy parents have a tract home with an average-sized yard for Goleta. We needed the bulk of the existing landscape demo'd, with the exception of a few trees and hardscape items. When Jose came to provide an initial estimate, we found him to be a friendly guy and were excited over the idea of our yards being transformed into the oasis we'd long envisioned. Seven months later, this three-month job is still under construction. \n\nWe appreciated how the work was billed in tiers. Rather than paying the full amount all at once, my parents would pay a bit at a time for the portion of work done. On that note, Sierra's bid was less expensive than some other landscapers we'd interviewed, which we also enjoyed. \n\nAs evidenced by the photos, Sierra delivered quality craftsmanship. The plants and lawn are coming in beautifully, the landscape lighting looks gorgeous at night, and the raised planter beds are just what we wanted.\n\nHowever, much of the initial momentum waned after month two or so. There would be weeks at a time with no work done - we did have a rain storm early on in 2019, but the timing on this didn't exceed three weeks. We were informed that there were several other current jobs on Sierra's pipeline, and never really felt like our project was a priority for them. It was a matter of my dad prodding Sierra to follow through with the procedure. For instance, when the lawn was installed, there was a two month delay before the irrigation was even operable - and now, some of the sprinklers are spraying hard water directly onto the brand new back bedroom windows. The fencing was constructed, but there was a four month gap until the gates were working. There was a good amount of cutting corners, here - I could go on but I'm sure you get the gist. \n\nSierra began working on the yard in November of 2018. It is now May of 2019 and per my dad, it is about 90% complete. As I am writing this on my parents' behalf, they have stated that they likely would not recommend Sierra to others. I may modify the review if they come and complete the work (it has been two weeks since we've last seen them), but for now, three stars it is.","date":"2019-05-18 19:04:27"}

We would've stayed if we could've afforded to, but it was already at the top of our rent budget when we moved in, so it just made sense for us to move to a more affordable place outside of downtown. However, the rent is actually very reasonable for those that can afford to pay premium prices to live downtown, and priced much better than some of the newer, luxury apartments downtown.\n\nOverall, we had a positive experience renting from Circle City Apartments and I would absolutely recommend them to a friend looking to rent in downtown Indy.","date":"2018-01-30 23:13:18"}

There are steak fries, chips, garlic fries, sweet potato fries. Great set of option here. \n\nI appreciate that when I asked for well-done, my burger was indeed well-done.

Delicious! The buns are to die for. They really impressed me. \n\nAlso at the table was a Prime Chophouse that looked appetizing. Glancing over the menu, there are several different burgers that I'd love to try.

The Landing Kitchen is built into the ground floor of the Bala Cynwyd Residence Inn, itself an homage to the Pencoyd Ironworks foundry. Industrial accents including exposed beams, garage-doors style windows, and converted metalwork highlight the atmosphere. The spacious patio hosts plenty of marble tables, complete with umbrellas and heat lamps to accommodate any weather. If you're lucky, you can grab a seat at one of the sophisticated lawn chairs, arranged around the large gas firepit. The riverside location offers uncharacteristically stunning snapshots of the Schuylkill (one-upped only by the views from the Pencoyd footbridge, only a stone's throw away). Order at the counter, then take a number to your table.\n\nWe arrived mid-morning for Sunday brunch to a moderately sized line. Despite the hordes of staff members, most seemed either distracted or clueless. The line nearly stretched out the door by the time we ordered.\n\nMy partner and I split The Ironworker and the Landing Breakfast Sandwich. Both sandos were moderately sized, and both would have immensely benefited from a more exciting bun. For the former, the richness of the pork roll and Cooper sharp pleasantly contrasted the sweet tomato spread; however, the potato roll felt flimsy. For the latter, the maple sausage \/ salsa verde combo sported a nice zing of flavor, but the shoe-like English muffin was dull and forgettable. The table also shared an order of BBQ Fries, which could not have a more misleading name -- they were limp steakhouse fries, unevenly seasoned and served with Heinz ketchup packets. The coffees ranged from standard to underwhelming; flavor shots in the iced coffees were decidedly flavorless, despite an associated upcharge.\n\nThe bill sat at nearly $20 a head (after tax and tip). While the sandwiches were a step above fast-food breakfast sandos, the premium on them feels borderline criminal. While the Landing Kitchen is worth a visit at least once to appreciate the scenery, don't hold your breath for a dining experience to match.","date":"2021-10-18 16:17:32"}

Well, Brentwood but close enough...and I didn't actually try the BBQ yet but it looks legit. The tables with grills are on the right side of the restaurant. If you just want the regular menu, you sit to the left. I went for lunch and was in the mood for some soup. Korean soup (or jjigae) is the best soup you will ever have. I used to live in Korea and would eat it almost every day when the weather was cold. Or hot. Or the next morning after a rough night. Ok, so it's always good (wiping off drool and getting back to my review). Sitting in the booth, it was pointed out to me that the table had a call button. This is what every restaurant in Korea has. If you need something, press the button. It might seem rude but it's actually pretty convenient. The menu has a mix of Japanese and Korean items. I didn't pay much attention to the sushi and focused on the Korean dishes. I was excited to see some great \"appetizers\" like tteokboki and pajeon. I knew I couldn't eat these plus a soup for lunch but I really want to go back for dinner and get some tteokboki. I knew right away what I wanted. Yukgaejang is my favorite Korean food. It's a spicy broth with shredded beef, egg, bean sprouts, glass noodles, and bracken (? I think this is the translation in English). If you've never had this, order it. It's life changing. I have had this at other  Korean restaurants in America and it has been a bit oily or just way too spicy (which it's supposed to be so that's fine). However, this one was perfect. It was spicy enough without killing me, it wasn't oily, and it had just the right amount of all the ingredients. This is the best bowl of yukgaejang I have had since coming back from Korea. The ban chan were also delicious and plentiful. My favorite dish is the cucumbers with the gochujang. Since it was lunch, I just had a Coke, but they have great prices on beer. They also have soju if you want to drink like a true Korean. Overall, this place is pretty authentic and seems to have all of my Korean favorites. I will be able to come here and fulfill all of my Korean cravings!","date":"2018-10-16 18:47:26"}

Some use dulse\/seaweed to give it a \"fishy\" taste, some use chopped celery to give it better texture, and all use some sort of vegan mayo. Basic 4's \"carrot tuna\" uses none and they don't add anything else to give it interesting flavor or texture. The sandwich was literally carrots on a pita. The pate appeared to be pure carrots pulverized in a food processor, with a little onion and maybe salt and lemon juice. How on earth is this supposed to resemble tuna? The plain carrot mixture was scooped into a pita bread with lettuce, onions, and tomatoes - no protein, and no mayo or sauce. It was the most boring sandwich I've ever had and a total waste of $6. I couldn't bring myself to finish it, so I took half of it home, added a veggie burger, some Veganaise and Siracha, and called it a day.\n\nI also ordered the cream of broccoli soup for about $5, which turned out to be very bland. I'm glad they offered a vegan cream soup, as much of their menu isn't vegan (it looks like some of the soy meats they use contain milk), but it tasted like the stereotypical vegan soup that you would NOT want your non-vegan friends to taste.

I have been to both the South Philly and the 17th and Sansom location's.  I enjoy the South Philly location a LITTLE more because each time I have been there - it's been way less crowded than the location on Sansom ever has been (Sansom location gets a LOT of traffic).  \n\nThe pizza at slice is really very good.  The crust is thin - the cheese is great - and there is NO grease.  I mean NONE.  Which I can seriously appreciate.  Additionally, they have a variety of cheese and dough options - which is great for people who are vegan, lactose intolerant, or are watching their weight.  The sauces taste good, and they always have an interesting combo of toppings \/ variety of pizza's that are great.  \n\nThe ambiance is simple, the service is good - the people are really friendly, but beware - they take only cash.  \n\nThe major DOWNSIDE of Slice is that it is a tad bit expensive.

The food is good, service was impeccable and the dining clearly is in the realm of experiential and fine. \n\nIf the comparison is any other place in Santa Barbara- it's safe to say you won't be disappointed. The dining experience at Carusos truly is a Michelin worthy experience and one that should be indulged in for a very special occasion. \n\nI was invited to dinner at Carusos October 2021. At this time the restaurant was doing dinner service with a prefix menu. There was an an Amuse Bouche, a starter, a main plate, and of course dessert for $180 per person. Well the price tag may seem stark, a seasoned fine dinner enthusiast will quickly understand the caliber of experience is well worth it, and the novice can't deny that nothing beats the view of the sun setting over Miramar Beach as you're having dinner. \n\nAlthough both our Cacio e Pepe and Steak were perfectly prepared, I was interested Chef Massimo Falsini's more creative dishes! Some unique touches like fresh chimichurri sauce on the steak a surprise, and genuinely made the dish go from perfect (boring but good) to memorable. The most pleasing thing for me was the the grilled octopus as a starter with a base of  mole ( I believe?) sauce. The Octopus was chard on the outside with a slight crisp and soft and tender in the inside. Sweet and savory sauce underneath was a perfect compliment, and it's rustic flavor lingered on the palate. The dish is clearly inspired by Latin flavor and did well to pay homage to our cultural heritage in SB. Highly recommend this and hope the chef continues to keep us feeling a sense of discovery in his food over the usual aim of classism and consistency. If he keep up the creativity I could see Caruso's becoming a place I revisit again and again. \n\nAs a wine enthusiast, I naturally brought wine from my own stash; my favorite Napa Valley table wine Overture by Opus One. The wine was juicy and velvety with enough structure to pair with the steak but not to overpowering for the octopus. . That being said there was a sommelier available.\n\nThe cocktail we each started with was was a great idea! Believe it or not, I'd took the mock tail which was inspired by Earl Grey tea and absolutely delicious. I would definitely order this again. My date ordered a dirty martini, and it was standard- just how we wanted it! \n\nAll in all, everything was delicious but what really left an impression was the flavor of the food accompanied by that dreamy pink and purple sunset over the water. I highly recommend booking a table outside on the patio for sunset.","date":"2021-12-17 05:13:57"}

She said they had catfish and they would make me some, which was a nice offer, but my partner had already ordered  from another restaurant and I didn't want to wait, so I had the fried chicken fingers.

The restaurant is gorgeous, harkening back to the old days of getting dressed up to go to dinner (though the dress code has undoubtedly relaxed since the place opened).\n\nWe chatted with the sommelier, who was knowledgeable and helpful. We enjoyed a few great bottles of wine, the highlight of our evening. Our server, Jarrod, was also fun, bantering with us during our meal. \n\nWe had a couple of appetizers -- the escargot and a seafood smorgasbord that included bbq shrimp and oysters. What was odd here was that the plating included the escargot on the plate with other items despite being ordered separately. This isn't a huge deal, but also made the appetizers less appetizing to one in our group who is not a fan of escargot. It was also odd in light of the bbq shrimp already being plated separately. \n\nI enjoyed the vichyssoise, and others had and enjoyed the caprese salad. The entrees, however, were truly disappointing. A few of us partook in the coolinary menu. The filets lacked salt. It was absolutely bland and disappointing. Nothing in the dish truly popped in terms of flavor. My husband had the fish which did have a tasty sauce but wasn't quite a home run. Another in our party ordered an a la carte fish entree and stopped eating after a couple of bites. It was clearly and tangibly an off night for the kitchen. \n\nTwo other things were exceptionally frustrating. First, when a back dining room emptied out, someone was in there vacuuming while the door to the room closest to our table remained wide open. This lasted at least 25 minutes before the door was closed, but the person vacuuming must've been aiming for a Guinness record as they then vacuumed for over an hour. (The room isn't large enough to warrant that, but maybe that's how they earn employee of the month?)\n\nFinally, the biggest upset was how restaurant employees actively avoided reminding patrons to wear their masks as they walked around. While I saw all employees wearing masks appropriately, it felt like a slap in the face to see them engage and banter with customers who were walking around the dining room without a mask. The restaurant needs to adhere strictly to state and local guidance which demands masks be worn inside. I understand that many employees may be tired of arguing with guests over this, but the safety of all trumps any semblance of discomfort for them. \n\nAll in all, an off night. I expected a lot more from an iconic restaurant like Dickie Brennan's, but they absolutely missed the mark. I am disappointed, and certainly recommend going elsewhere, especially for a true quality upscale dining experience.","date":"2021-08-07 16:01:30"}

Previously, I had damaged nerve on the lower corner of my lips, and I mainly seek to have the side with the damaged nerve look symmetric to the normal side.\n\nTheir base prices are probably some of the better prices I've seen in the area.

When I was brought into the room, my lips were numbed before I even spoke to the doctor. When the doctor came in with the syringe, he briefly asked what kind of look I was going for and started right away.\n\nI understand that it wasn't my first time getting this done, but it was my second, and I'm new to this place and by no means a pro.

There was some bruising, which is normal.\n\nI think it's nice, however, that he saved a little bit in the syringe so that when the swelling goes down, if there's anything that needs to be fixed, I don't have to buy a whole new syringe just to touch up a small area.\n\nWhile I wasn't blown away by my experience here, I am thrilled with the results that I received. I would definitely trust my lips again with Dr. Pinto.","date":"2019-04-02 15:10:59"}

Honestly, I wasn't planning to make a full meal out of our happy hour outing, but that completely changed after glancing around at the dishes our neighbors at the bar were getting. Everything looked so delicious!\n\nFirst off, you are required to sit at the bar if you plan to order off of their happy hour menu. Ideally, we would have loved to sit at a table, but the bar ended up being just fine. The bartender was nice and friendly, although the service was pretty slow (more on that later).\n\nWe first started off with a glass of red sangria which might have been some of the best sangria I've ever had. It was very fruity and sweet but definitely packed a punch. My original plan was to call it a night after just one drink, but it was so good that I ended up getting a second. My friend got a white sangria for her second round and said the red was far better than the white.\n\nAs for food, we indulged in a variety of different small plates including Shrimp Cóctel, Pineapple Guacamole Cubano, a Churrasco Slider, Chicken Croquetas, and a few empanadas. All were really great but my personal favorites were the empanadas and the guacamole! The pulled pork empanada that I had was extremely flavorful, fried to perfection, and served with some kind of dipping sauce that I loved. It was quite filling as well! The guacamole was fresh and had chunks of pineapple which offered a sweet taste to this normally savory dish. They were served with plantain chips which I really enjoyed. The plantain chips weren't nearly as crisp as a tortilla chip would be, but I really liked them nonetheless. The presentation was also superb. \n\nThe small plates are only $5 during happy hour which is an awesome deal. If you want to try a bunch of different things, I would encourage you to get the sampler. The sampler allows you to choose any seven small plates for just $31. That's what we did and it was a really good decision. I left completely stuffed and I was able to make this my dinner for the night!\n\nAs for the service, although it started off well, it was on a downward slope as the night went on. As happy hour came to a close, the bartenders became less attentive and we had to flag someone down numerous times for water refills and our check. Our corner of the bar was filled with dirty plates and our first round of empty drinks.\n\nStill, I was very content with my overall happy hour experience. In fact, my friend and I have already talked about returning! The specials were great, the food and drinks were solid, and the prices were very reasonable. Hopefully everything stays up to par next time and maybe there will even be some improvement in service!","date":"2018-10-03 02:49:09"}

Every time I've come here, I've ordered different dishes in hopes of finding something I can stick with and be satisfied. That has never happened. At this point, I must have tried 2 different burgers, 2 different sandwiches, and at least one wrap, if not two. All of them...eh. Not the worst thing I've ever eaten, but far from the best.

They made the wrap right away, there was almost no waiting and it was really cheap! I hate paying a ton for fancy Indian food because most of the time the recipes come from regions where the people who cook the recipes live on very little income. The tastes in this wrap were comparable to some of the best Indian food I've tried. I think this is a chain, if it is I haven't tried any other locations. They have seating inside and outside. It is a quick service restaurant where the employees are always behind the counter and you pick the food up from the counter. There is a case of bottled and canned drinks. The white sauce is not a garlic sauce, it tastes more like ranch, it did not fit on my sandwich, so I didn't use it. Overall I'll definitely be back when I'm craving Indian!

We were in town celebrating a birthday and decided to give Green Eggs a try. Upon arrival, we were greeted and sat immediately. We started with a carafe of Peach Bellini, which was great. We ordered The Oreo French Toast, Apple Pie French toast and Pecan French toast, along with Shrimp and Grits. Now, I had to send the shrimp and grits back, because they weren't hot. They also only put five shrimp in the entire dish, and I expected a few more. After sending the shrimp and grits back, I decided to order the Red Velvet pancakes, which took a long time to come because they are made to order. By the time they came, my friends were already finished eating! The Red Velvet Pancakes were hot and huge, but definitely lacked flavor-- like it tasted like some plain batter, that's it! \n\nLet's get into the French Toast... The French toast was absolutely AMAZING!!! Each one we ordered was packed with flavor! The Oreo was my absolute favorite! It was made with Challah bread, and had Oreo stuffed inside. Talk about a foodgasim!!! If you come here, you MUST try the FRENCH TOAST! It's probably legit the best French toast I've had. \n\nIn addition to the food, the service was great as well.

Spend your 10k for a wedding elsewhere where people will actually value your money and will be nice to you. In the middle of planning our wedding, we got switched to a different coordinator who made it clear through email and in person that she did not want to deal with us. She treated us as if she did not want to deal with us because she did not make commission from our wedding. And let me say this, I am by no means a bridezilla. We're all human, all I ask is that if you mess up, you apologize for it and be nice to me if I am spending money at your establishment. \n\n  Planning my \"destination\" wedding started off great at the Grand Plaza. I was working with Kate and visited the property. She was warm, friendly and helpful. We even met with another coordinator who was friendly as well. 9 months before my wedding I got an email saying that Kate is no longer with the company and that Kristin would be taking care of us. I emailed Kristin early September to say that we would be in the area on the 13th to the 16th of this month and could we do our tasting. Due to our flights and the timing that they offer tastings, we could only squeeze in a 30 minute tasting. We had been emailing back and forth confirming the 16th. Kristin emailed me the menu selections on the 20th. Not once did she mention that she needed the tasting menu selections back within a certain time frame. I emailed her on the 12th with our menu selections to which she responded \"Unfortunately, we need a two week notice for a tasting. Is there any other time you can come in?\"  I emailed her back reminding her that this was a destination wedding so there is no other time and that we had been discussing coming in on the 16th since the beginning of September and not once did she mention a deadline or follow up if she needed them back in a certain time. On the 13th I spoke with her and her response was very dry \"yeah I see what you mean.\" Never apologized but said they were able to do the tasting. \n That Saturday, October 14th when we had an actual meeting with Kristin and a tour of the property. Throughout the tour, Kristin was very condescending, unhelpful and unfriendly. When we asked questions, she responded as if our questions were stupid. She talked to us like we were children. She even rolled her eyes when I asked to see guest rooms. This was after I mentioned on the phone and when we first arrived that it was my fiancé's first time at the property so he wanted to see guest rooms. During the meeting, I brought up the fact that she spelled our names wrong in the email. She looked at the screen, looked at the file and then said \"yeah it's in here right,\" again looking at us like we were stupid. Again, never apologizing!  Today, I spoke with Gloria, the assistant manager, who offered to switch me to a different coordinator. She apologized and said they would handle it on their end but kept bringing up \"personalities not meshing.\" Personalities have nothing to do with professionalism. After a lot of haggling, Gloria offered the additional $150 I left for the glamour room but refused to give me back the $500 deposit as if I want to plan an entire wedding again six months before my date!","date":"2017-10-20 21:06:35"}

Taste of the Hibachi steak = New York strip AND the 'other' dinner which had filet mignon with shrimp was good, just nothing extraordinary.\n\nThe soup was good, the salad was good though it could have used a little less of the ginger dressing. Like the fried rice a lot! Very tasty! And the sides\/appetizers of shrimp, zucchini, and onions was also pretty good! Also had the spider roll (sushi) which was really tasty, but should have been a little longer - couple more pieces.\n\nBut above all, what you are going for is the show! And as always, it is always fun!! Our chef had only been there a couple weeks, so his talent may not have been as refined as others... but is also wasn't as rehearsed as others! Had fun with him and enjoyed the show!\n\nOverall it is a great place for an occasion... also fun place to take the kids!","date":"2011-10-19 00:19:14"}

I have pretty much stopped going to buffets since I have lost a lot of weight in the last few years, but I \nhaven't been to a South American steakhouse in 7-8 yrs (Texas De Brazil)\n\nNote: If you've not done so join their email club, they will email you a $15 dollar coupon. I did this and was able to use it today.\n\nLet the tempting of the Uric Acid Gods begin!\n\nTGBS is in a plaza which is attached to Salon Loft and a Credit Union. It is adjacent to Wright's Gourmet House. Thankfully, there is adequate parking in a lot.\n\nThe interior is very classy with mostly a light gray motif. The salad bar is in the center  of the dining area. Many waiters are scurrying about attending to guests with gray outfits and the gauchos are clad in red shirts and are brandishing skewers. Depending on the time of day, you can just get the salad bar or just the meats I went with the full dining experience at $45.\n\nI ordered a Caiprinha. It is a Brazilian staple alcoholic drink with lime,sugar ,and cachaca (spirit from fermented sugarcane IIRC) In a superficial sense, it taste similar to mojito, but more robust. It was very strong ($10).  4.5\/5\n\nThe Salad Bar was very elaborate and had more non veg items than veg from hat I could see. It included cheese, prosciutto, salami, french bread, salad, bacon, roasted peppers, a mushroom dish I can't spell. While it was the most varied salad bars I've seen, I didn't sample everything to due to being more excited for the meats. I didn't see Lobster Bisque there like Annah P said Darn.\n\nMany South American Steakhouses use a system where you place a disk with green side up to indicate to the gauchos that you want meat. Red side up means you don't want meat served. They have many cuts of different meat including steak, chicken, pork , salmon.  \n\nWhat I prefer about the SAS is that imo they season the meat better than American ones. Some people have mentioned that  meat is too salty at these types of restaurants, but I did not feel that here at TGBS.  I tried picanha, sirloin, rib, chicken , and sausages. They even have proteins you can request. A couple ahead of me got a grilled shrimp skewer. Neat.\n\nIn addition to the meat, other servers bring mashed potatoes, sweet plaintains, grilled pineapple slices, and cassava cheese bread. \n\n Picanha and sirloin were soft , juicy, and packed with flavor.  5\/5\nEverything  else was generally  4\/5.\nThe Cassava Cheese bread was serviceable. It's a nice idea and its different but the taste was just ok. To be honest, filling up with side dishes especially starch wasn't part of my game plan.  3\/5\n\nThe service was magnificent. The gauchos were on point and polite. The other servers were generous with the other non meat side dishes. Water was refilled with the efficiency of a military unit under General Patton.   It is truly commensurate with the price of the meal.  Indian restaurants should send their servers here for boot camp.  5\/5\n\nFrom all this gushing , you would expect a 5\/5 mark, but the one main negative is price. While the product is good, the price is prohibitive. This is mostly a place for special occasions like birthdays,anniversaries, etc. \nThe lunch service is around $30, but Im sure the variety is less compared to the dinner service. Plus, eating this much red meat frequently would make all the gastroenterologists of the world turn into the Hulk.  I cannot say if TGBS is better than Texas De Brazil, Fogo De Chau, and all the other similar , but it is indeed a great special meal in a nice venue with exemplary service.","date":"2019-02-18 03:42:23"}

He was busy but took our order for pick up the next afternoon. \nWent to pick up and clueless hostess sent me to bartender again, fiod not ready and told to wait.No offer of beverage or water while waiting, and she was also too busy to be bothered with takeout order. \n\nThe food: lasagne was heated according to directions, but was lacking in flavor and kind of chewy. Salad was fresh romaine with cheese and crutons, but no salad dressing in bag or on salad. Bread was too dense for my diners. They also said it didn't have and garlic flavor. It was like garlic butter poured on top, but nothing on the actual slices.\nLastly and the worst was the tiramisu. Looked ok in container, but was a soupy mess. If there were lady fingers they disolved into the coffee flavored goo in the container.  Was there alcohol in it? Opinions were mixed, we did not want alcohol in it. \nWe served this meal about 2 hours after pick up, so no excuse for awful dessert unless it was made long before and thawed out.\nNope. Won't  revisit. Typical bland american style chain restaurant. Half of the menu is bar drinks, so maybe that explains all the rave reviews.

Bangkok was one of the first restaurants I loved in Reno. We'd drive from the NW regularly to enjoy the food, and always loved the lively atmosphere of everyone gathered on a Friday or Saturday night. \n\nI can still remember the first time I had the Bangkok Sizzling Platter. The fresh spinach was bright green on arrival, but after pouring the peanut sauce over the top you could watch and smell as it sauteed together with the protein all on a sizzling platter. Intoxicating aromas filled the air and the people you were dining with were always jealous they didn't get the same thing. \n\nAs I moved south, I sadly lost touch with Bangkok, as I began to favor the convenience of restaurants closer to me. During API Heritage Month 2021 though, I've been getting out and exploring these spots again, and I'm so glad I made this a priority.\n\nBangkok has some serious history in the community (25 years to be exact). You can see it in the smiles that fill the room and feel it in the air too. Everyone is a friend from the minute you walk in the door, and after tasting the food, you'll know exactly why so many have been coming for all these years.\n\nOn my recent visit I tried the Thai Dumplings, duck larb, black pepper beef, and the fried calamari, all of which were phenomenal. I'm coming back for the crispy duck and the stuffed wings, along with several other dishes that were calling to me but I couldn't have in one visit! \n\nBangkok Cuisine was one of the bright spots for me in 2020. While the restaurant industry was facing some of the most difficult circumstances ever, Kris L kept his team focused and motivated through it all, and even found ways to give back to others who needed it more than they did. \n\nI hope you'll give it a try too!","date":"2021-05-18 00:59:27"}

This place just sucks. I have no idea how it can go on like this unchanged for so long. Employees are rude can't be bothered types. Place is filthy because the rude can't be bothered types can't be bothered to do anything but have an attitude and mess up your order. The drive thru is a joke. And when you get stuck waiting in it forever you can't leave cuz there's no way to go around, so you're trapped. They've never once gotten my order right. Never. I'll  ask for BBQ sauce and they'll hand me the bag literally two seconds later without it. And then have an attitude when you ask for it again. Last time, I opened my bag while still sitting there because I was positive it wouldn't be right. I was literally missing 4 things. And I had to ask four separate times for the stuff because I'd tell her about 1 thing missing and she'd slam the door shut go get it and come back so I'd have to keep saying what's missing one by one. Just so needlessly rude. And I have terrible anxiety so I HATE having to ask for the missing things and all that. But what can you do when they don't give you half your stuff! It's honestly the most poorly run fast food establishment I've ever been to in my life. And it's such a shame, because the chicken sandwich is pretty good. The last 2 times I tried to go- I didn't even get served. One time they said they were closed when it was more then an hour before closing time, and the second time they literally just came over the intercom and said they were \"out of product.\" It's a Taco Bell\/KFC combo, so you're telling me you were out of absolutely everything from both places?! Yeah, sure. The cars in front of us were served, so I'm assuming they just decided they were done early. They seem to do that often. Oh and like I said before, you're trapped in the drive thru, so I had to sit there and wait for the people in front of us who actually did get served to get thru. So I sat in a drive thru for 15 minutes to not get any food. That was the final straw. I'll never go back there. Really wish they would overhaul that place cuz like I said, I really like the food.

I'm glad that I didn't order any sides, mynbelly would bust. Got my food back home and dug in. Tasted like tuna to me, thick consistency compared to my usual catfish.

They tasted the way they were described, like truffle eggs. They were ok, I wouldn't order them again but I will always ask about the devil egg flavor of the day!\n\nThere's also a dip of the day too!

We called the restaurant to confirm they did not mistakenly give us an appetizer portion and were told that what we received was the main course.

Asian Paradise was my go to neighborhood Chinese restaurant for quite some time. I can recall sending a lot of great folks there over the years as well. I loved the fact they offered a very diverse menu that represented several Asian cuisines, and that they offered some pretty authentic dishes and versions of popular dishes as well.\n\nI'm reducing my previous 5 star review as a result of two recent experiences here. Truthfully the food served last night was closer to a two, but I know this restaurant does better so I'm giving the benefit of the doubt.\n\nThe first was about a mont and a half ago. It was a Sunday evening and we wanted Chinese takeout, but knowing the current status of the restaurant industry, I called to be sure they were open before we ordered. A gentleman answered and affirmed they were open, but politely let me know it was takeout only until about 6\/7 due to a large private party that was in the dining room. I let him know I wanted takeout and that id call back in 5 minutes with an order. \n\nLiterally 5 minutes later I started calling. I rang both phone numbers listed for Asian Paradise no less than a combined 50 times (no exaggeration), both simply landing me in a voicemail confirming I was in the right place. I eventually left a voicemail just to see if I'd get a call back, but 6 weeks later and still nothing.\n\nLast night we got to order! Three dishes: Kung Pao Triple Delight dry style, House Pan Fried Noodle and Salt & Pepper Calamari.\n\nThe calamari was tough. My son chewed his way through it and I didn't get more than a bite. After that bite I thought about calling the restaurant but decided this must be what they serve and assumed I'd ordered poorly.\n\nThe Kung Pao was generally tasty, but several pieces of the beef were extremely tough and inedible. I also couldn't tell if what we got was the dry style. Perhaps it was, just a little more saucy than I'm used to seeing. Aside from the saucy look that I wasn't expecting, it was also hiding a helluva Ma La punch from Sichuan peppercorns. I believe Kung Pao has origins in Sichuan, but if that's the standard here, the Americanized palate needs a little heads up that's coming. I've not experienced that Sichuan flavor profile in this dish at any restaurant that didn't specifically call it out. I enjoy that type of numbing spice, so this was kinda fun for me, but I'd imagine it would be pretty painful for those that didn't know.\n\nThe pan fried noodles were the biggest disappointment. I appreciated that they packed the crispy noodles separately from the gravy so we didn't end up with soggy noodles by the time we got home, but the gravy itself was more cornstarch than anything else. This dish is supposed to have a delicate brown gravy that gently coats the protein and vegetables and crispy noodles, but this had way too much thickener and was best described as gloppy and gelatinous. This was not a good version of this dish and was borderline inedible.\n\nSo two dishes I didn't want to or couldn't eat and a third my spice loving soul struggled to complete add up to a n  experience that was really not that great. I'm not sure if something changed here during the last few years, but this isn't the Asian Paradise I used to love.","date":"2021-08-03 04:45:37"}

We heard it was a family dining restaurant, so we brought our children with us. (ages 10 and 2) Our 10 year old ordered a bacon cheeseburger off the kids menu. It was GIANT, it was the same size as ours! Our 2 year old also had a burger. (We should have known better and ordered one that they could have split it.) There were no fruit side options for the kids to choose from. \nDue to them running out of highchairs, we were seated in a hightop booth with a booster seat for our toddler. The booster normally wouldn't have been a problem, but it was pretty sketchy having him sit in a booster in such a high booth. We had to scoot the table closer to him so he could reach the table, thus leaving the table short on the other side for the rest of the family. We were told that they were out of high chairs. We finally requested a move to another table after a family with a toddler using a regular high chair left. That made our seating arrangement 100% better. \nThe menu is pretty cut and dry...and easy to order from. I got the 317 Burger, as suggested by our waiter. (beef patty, garlic aioli, pepper bacon and cheese) I also ordered the poutine fries. \nThe burger looked great on the plate, it was adorned with a bamboo skewer with a pickle on top....\nThe flavor was not very good at all, the bun was GIANT and dry and the bacon wasn't crispy at all.  The garlic aioli was hard to find, and hard to taste. I ended up taking the top portion of the bun off and cutting the burger with a fork and knife and dipping into ketchup and the gravy from the poutine. \nThe poutine was pretty good. The fries were delicious and freshly cut. The cheese curds weren't very melty, but the gravy was great! Overall, that part was what I ate the most of!\n\nI am super excited for this business....but it will be a while before we return so they will be able to work out the kinks.","date":"2013-12-15 15:48:30"}

I've had more than one negative encounter with the check-in staff, but this encounter was inexcusable.  \n\nOur dog injured herself and I wanted to just get an initial assessment on the severity of the wound. My thought was could it wait until I scheduled an appointment for the next day, or should something be done immediately?  \n\nI asked the check-in staff at McCordsville Veterinary Hospital if someone could just take 5 minutes and look at the wound.  I admit, the time was later in the afternoon, but I was told there was no way anyone could see my pet.  I could take her to the Animal Emergency Hospital in Carmel, followed with that \"is all we can offer\". I was also offered an appointment the next day, which I took.\n\nIntuitively I thought the injury wasn't life-threatening, but I wanted peace of mind and the animal's health ensured. I drove to McCordsville Veterinary Hospital and called from the lot, to ask again if someone would just come out and assess our dog's wound.  As I waited with the other two cars in the lot, I was again told it was not possible for anyone to come out. \n\nI took her to a nearby groomer, thinking she could be helpful.

The rolls here were cooked to order and delicious. They were also affordable and served up fast. What more can you ask for?\n\nWe had a late check-in at our hotel and were hungry. We ended up leaving our hotel for dinner around 11:15pm. I looked on Yelp for a good, quick, casual place to eat that was also open late. We were tired and I didn't feel like eating at a sit-down restaurant. Masala Kitchen popped up and checked all the boxes. They're open until 3:30am on Friday and Saturday nights. A friend also recommended this place to us.\n\nThis is a small fast-casual restaurant located in Center City, just four blocks from Philadelphia City Hall. It's right next to the entrance of a public parking garage. Seating inside is limited to about 24 seats. They have standard two-tops with Tolix chairs and a couple long high-tops with Tolix stools.\n\nDuring our visit late on a Friday night between 11pm-12am, there was a small, but steady stream of customers. Most of the orders were takeout and delivery. We were the only dine-in customers at the time. The restaurant had plenty of staff on-hand. The kitchen is open. Bottled and canned drinks (from a fridge), sauces, eating utensils, and napkins are self-serve. The space itself is simple and looked relatively new and clean. The ambiance is that of a takeout joint. Since this restaurant is close to a lot of bars, it's perfect for those wanting a late-night snack or meal after a night on the town.\n\nThe menu is in the business name: kati rolls and platters. Kati rolls are an Indian street food from Kolkata (Calcutta), West Bengal. Masala Kitchen offers 14 varieties of kati rolls, ranging in price from $4.50 to $5.75 a roll. Buy two kati rolls, get $1 off. One or two rolls is good enough for a meal for most people. Ingredient options include chicken, beef, lamb, paneer (cheese), egg, vegetables, potatoes, Indian spices, and more.\n\nThe platters remind me of the platters you can get from The Halal Guys. For example, they have a Chicken-N-Rice platter ($8.75) and the self-serve sauces are similar too -- creamy white and spicy red. In addition, you can get biryani ($9.25-$10.00 each) and a paneer platter ($10). Drinks include mango and rose lassi ($3.70 each), chaas (an Indian yogurt drink, $3.70), masala chai ($3), and more.\n\nThe two of us ordered and split the following three rolls:\n\n* Chicken Masala ($5.75) - marinated grilled chicken with Indian creamy tomato sauce \"Makhani\" and crispy onions\n* Achari Paneer ($5.50) - marinated paneer with hint of mango pickle sauce, fresh mint-coriander chutney, and crispy onions\n* Mix Veggie ($5.50) - fresh pea, carrot, and green bean mixture cooked in Indian spices with fresh mint-coriander chutney and crispy onions plus egg (+$0.50)\n\nThese rolls were great. My favorite was the achari paneer, but I'm fan of paneer. Everything was made fresh to order and came out piping hot. Each roll was wrapped in brown paper and Sharpied to identify the rolls.\n\nThe kati rolls are wrapped in what the restaurant calls a \"tawa roti.\" Traditionally, tawa refers to the round, flat metal griddle used in Indian cooking. The roti here had a nice thickness to it, soft, and kind of fluffy with a sort of pillowy texture, lightly charred and appetizing. I like to describe Masala Kitchen's kati rolls as the Indian equivalent of the Taco Bell Chalupa or Gordita. In terms of the shell\/wrap, they are more similar to the Gordita (softer, less crispy, not deep fried).\n\nEach of the rolls was packed with flavor. If you like Indian food, I don't think the kati rolls here will disappoint you. The authentic, aromatic, and mouthwatering flavors were all there. The Mixed Veggie roll had a mushier consistency than the other rolls, but that wasn't surprising given the ingredients. I think adding egg to that roll really enhanced it. On the menu and item descriptions above, \"crispy onions\" refer to fresh, raw slices of red onion.\n\nFor sauces, I recommend getting a cup of the white sauce, adding a little bit of red to it, and mixing them together. The red sauce is quite spicy so a little goes a long way. The sauces by themselves are tasty too, so really it's a matter of personal preference. I dipped the rolls into the sauce mixture each time I took a bite. Yum.\n\nVaishali was our server and she was nice. Masala Kitchen uses the Revel POS system. Transactions, including tipping, are handled on a tablet and you can send yourself an itemized receipt.","date":"2019-07-12 19:07:02"}

I sat at a video poker free seat at the front bar alone. \n\nI sat there for over five minutes while three staff members, including a manager, buzzed around the bar helping customers and counting inventory. I got up, went to the back bar where the staff were gathered, and told them I was sitting there. \n\nThe manager brought me water and a few minutes later one of the bartenders came over to take my order. He was very friendly! \n\nI asked for a mezcal margarita. Instead, he made me the signature Cadillac Margarita with a mezcal floater. I'm not a Cadillac fan, but, the acid and savory nature of the mezcal cut through the sweetness of the OJ. It was so good - I ordered a second! \n\nI ordered the quesabirria (the bartender said it was great and I love it!), however, the kitchen was out (it's a rather special dish, so I wasn't surprised). I asked his other favorite dish and he recommended the Shrimp Diablo Tacos. And yes - he was very genuine in his suggestion. \n\nIt was a hearty portion with refried beans, fresh salsa, rice, and two tacos. \n\nI requested chips and salsa twice from the bartender but did not receive them. I love crunch with my Mexican food, and I'm happy to pay extra for chips and salsa. I noticed that folks in the dining room around me were getting complimentary chips. However, I noticed people by themselves weren't. Since I did not receive them from the bartender, I asked the runner who brought my food. He had to go out of his way to ask the manager if he could give me chips and salsa. She said yes.\n\nAs a woman who travels around the world alone, nothing annoys me more than being ignored, \"missed,\" or denied the same thing as couples or larger groups. Just give me a smaller portion, fine by me. \n\nRegardless, my tacos were delicious and the chips and salsa were, too. \n\nOverall, I'd visit El Jefe's again.

Unfortunately, 0 stars was not an option so I had no other choice but to give 1 star. I came to this practice to get fitted for orthotics.

I personally called my insurance company to verify if this information was accurate, which was not the case. The insurance company informed me that I DO NOT HAVE TO BE A DIABETIC to get orthotics. I called the office back to inform them of my conversation with the insurance company along with providing them with a reference number. The girl Danielle who I guess is the office manager, who felt the need to tell me that she's been in the medical field for 12 years (irrelevant), basically said that she is not going with what the insurance company is telling me since its not accurate info and that I need to pay them 100% of the cost. I find this absolutely insane that this practice refused to go through my insurance company for orthotics and they are even in network with my insurance company!! Total scam and money hungry people.

Honestly,  that's all I could ever ask of a business, to be open to hearing a customer's perspectiveand to take appropriate action. So refreshing.

One thing I can say is that if she hates her job so much, leave so she can stop being miserable, and making everyone miserable. This property is poorly managed. Windows and doors are not properly insulated so bugs tend to creep their way in to the apartment. It's a constant problem that they don't seem to care about. Next issue I have is the kids running around the complex like animals. There were several occasions where I almost hit a kid because they simply run out on to the street with no care at all. Next is the parking. If you have a nice car, be prepared to have plenty of dings on your door and a lot of scratches. Another parking issue I have is tenants\/visitors tend to park wherever they fell like. If you are on the back side of the complex, between buildings B & C, cars constantly park in front where it is a red zone. God bless the maintenance guy whom I've seen sticking warning stickers on windshield. It tends to stop for a few days, then people start parking thagain. I will attach an example of how considerate these people are. (For example, that van either parks on that road or next to the mustang parked in the handicap, who doesn't ever seem to leave). \n\nUnits are mediocre at best. I will definitely leave this property once my lease is up. My suggestion is, don't make this your permanent \"home.\" However, if you're in a financial crunch or would like to save money, this will serve its purpose. \n\nIf you decide to live here, deal with Judy. She's very helpful. IMO, she should be running this place. I'm sure there will be significant improvements.","date":"2017-07-16 01:01:30"}

When I got there I went to the front, but was told to go to the back if I wanted to see a dog. No problem. \n\nWhen I get to the back, I speak to Susie and explain my situation. \n\nWe were looking for a companion for our dog, Luna, who was once used as a bait dog and struggles with anxiety. She needed a dog friend. \n\nI didn't hide Luna's history and I showed photos to Susie which showed her lack of fur and scarred appearance. Susie agreed Cisco would be a great option for us because of his calm and easy going nature. I asked if we could bring Luna in the morning to meet with Cisco. She agreed enthusiastically.\n\nNext morning, I walk in and Cisco is covered in dried mud. We got there not long after they opened meaning he probably had that mud on him all night. \n\nSusie isn't there so I found another woman (blonde) and explain what I discussed with Susie. She and the brunette back there were clearly annoyed I was there. I asked if we could do the meet and greet in the front office's waiting room due to our dog being previously abandoned and we didn't want her to think we were going to leave her. We were denied. They bring Cisco out, in the rain, and as soon as the first woman saw our dog all of her walls went up.\n\nWe are completely fine with questions regarding our dog. They are understandable. We are happy to answer questions and provide examples if need be. We also understanding needing to be on your guard during meet and greets. However, the way the looked at and treated our dog was unacceptable.\n\nLuna is obviously nervous but it isn't because of the puppy. It's because of the environment. \n\nPlease note: Luna is mainly ignoring the puppy and not once did she show any aggression. \n\nThe blond woman begins to imply our dog may bite the puppy even though Luna is clearly staying focused on staying with my husband.  We tell her that's never happened and we have a firm handle on her regardless. Despite this, for the next 30 minutes we continue to hear about how we \"just never know\" and about how our dog has the potential to be violent. I wonder if they'd do that if it was a scarred up lab or golden retriever? I doubt it. \n\n A brunette wouldn't stop glaring at Luna and even had the audacity to ask if Luna had \"ever even been AROUND puppies?!\" in a hateful, short, accusatory voice while looking at Luna like she's a monster. Luna had puppies herself. \n\nAs soon as they saw Luna, they made their decision on our approval status and they made it very clear. \n\nDuring the whole meet and greet, the blonde told multiple stories to try prove \"we just never know\" because she lacked the social grace to realize enough was enough (even after we expressed our frustration at her continuous accusations). She even told a story about how she found out her \"sweet\" dog was racist. Dogs reflect the prejudices of their owners so we found that interesting. She even used a story regarding a dog that'd been clearly overbred to make a point that Luna could suddenly attack. It was unbelievable. The lack of social intelligence was staggering. \n\nWe get the concern (and I'm sure their reaction wasn't meant to be hateful or personal), but they made it clear they believed us naive and it was only a matter of time before \"Luna snapped\". Like we would endanger a puppy for the sake our own desires. The vibes made the whole thing awkward and awful. Dogs can sense that so of course Luna was afraid. I would be too if I had two women looking at me like that. \n\nI expressed my concerns regarding their behavior to a woman upfront who tried to act like they were just stressed and that they are one of the few to rescue puts (wrong - most adoption places do now - the fact you even see that as a badge of honor is a problem because pits shouldn't be viewed as extra special cases or more dangerous ones). I was met with what felt to be empty apologies and weak excuses. We left and found a perfect puppy at the Humane Society of Sumner County. The people there were incredible and kind. \n\nThis was our first experience with our sweet Luna being looked at like she was a monster. Everyone who knows her loves her. \n\nPlease see attached photos of new puppy (Remus) and our \"dangerous\"  Luna - one photo is her and a tripod cat whose her bestie.  \n\nI'm sure the dog will find a good home, but the way they spoke to us and acted towards our dog was beyond terrible. \n\nTL;DR: the people at this place have no social grace or manners. They make you feel like a burden and judge dogs based on appearance and act like they are the only ones who know much about dogs to the point of acting like they know YOUR dog better than you do...I'm sure they have saved many lives, but they need better bedside manner and kinder volunteers. \n\nThank you","date":"2019-03-11 22:49:27"}

I have a chipped molar (#31) that has become infected and needed to see the dentist ASAP. They got me in, racked my insurance for X-rays of my entire mouth, despite the current X-rays I brought of the tooth. That should have been my first clue but I was in pain and my teeth are in bad shape so I overlooked it, hoping to get my cracked tooth fixed or removed. \nHe gave me antibiotics and pain meds and the lovely assistant cleaned my teeth. \nAfter looking at my X-rays, Dr. Kopp was almost judgmental about the condition of my teeth and spoke to me in a tone that can only be described as condescending. I freely admitted right away that I had neglected my teeth for a bit and that certain medications I had been prescribed, also took their toll. \nHe was quiet, non communicative, and just looked at my X-rays, told me I have a few cavities and also need some root canals..... very vague.....so I had to pry the info from him like which teeth, what was covered, etc etc. \nI scheduled the extraction of the cracked tooth, and granted, it really hurts, but I waited two weeks. That morning they called and cancelled me because the doctor \"had a head cold\". \nSo I then rescheduled.....3 weeks later, still in pain, out of antibiotics at this point and I get a phone call two hours prior to my appointment to say that the doctor has decided I need to see a dental surgeon for my extraction and would not be removing my tooth. \n*** Mind you, online it says they do oral surgery***\nHe could have told me this from the beginning and I could have had the tooth removed five times over by now but instead, I waited, trusted the doctor, gave him the benefit of the doubt with his \"head cold\" non sense all while being in pain, that escalates daily due to the infection. \nThat is not very good ethics, or bedside manor as far as I am concerned. He let me go on and suffer while awaiting services promised by their office that were never provided. \nSteer clear of this facility, they are out to charge up insurance plans and if you aren't a big money investment, they will invest no time on your dental needs. \nSuch a complete waste of time and just a huge disappointment. \nLike I said to the receptionist, thanks for nothing.","date":"2021-12-31 14:12:31"}

How I haven't posted a review yet, I'm not sure. Every time I've shopped here for myself or with others, I leave feeling like I've found more than what I thought I needed (great for any gardener to feel that happiness and this was certainly true on my most recent visit). \n\nIf you're looking for seeds, plants, ready to eat veggies & fruit, various garden maintenance items, home & garden accessories or decor items, this is a great place to shop. If you're on a time or budget limit, you might need to go in with someone else to help you focus and cover more ground. There's always a lot to look at and if you go often enough, there's even a stamp card to fill up (I won't go into the details, as another yelper explained that really well already). \n\nThe last visit I'm recalling (in Aug 2021), I noticed they had a decent discount on remaining vegetables, herbs and flowers for your garden. To a point it distracted me from my original mission of buying veggies for my upcoming meals. Well only a little... as I bought some lovely mature herbs of basil, stevia and chives to add to my patio garden. I stocked up on the veggies I went there for but made a note to myself about the cases of BC fruit. I'm writing this review now as I forgot it in drafts and found it again when sharing this location with relatives and friends. Most recently my Aunt picked up potatoes from there (Oct 2021), so the food area is still available as well as all the neat extra things closer to the tills.\n\nParking lot is large enough one wouldn't struggle to find a spot, it's flat and it's paved. The entrance\/exit is both flat, making it welcoming for all levels of mobility. \n\nThe signs could be a bit more strategically placed so one actually goes into the right greenhouse area for plants, types of flowers, veggies & fruit (fruits & veggies were at the far end of the connecting greenhouses but in the past years the veggies & fruit were close to the exit & tills). \n\nI also passed a lot of staff in the greenhouse but no one asked me if I was finding what I was looking for, if needed help with anything I was looking at or if I knew that they were closing up soon. It wasn't until I reached the till I realized what time it was with all the staff gathered near the exit waiting for the greenhouse to close. That was an odd feeling but I appreciate the cashier & what I assume was the owner for still taking time to chat with me and make sure I knew about the punch card and had everything I needed. \n\nWhile exiting, I noticed a bunch of very happy greenhouse cats and one very lovely old greenhouse dog.

This 2-star review is based solely on this location alone.  I live in St.Pete with no ST close to me.  This ST location is always such a jam-packed, chaotic, circus of a line-waiting and noisy \"adventure,\" that my family just prefers to make the drive and dine at the ST in Palm Harbor...)\n\nI'm a proud carnivore and the nearly-meatless Sweet Tomatoes may still be my favorite chain restaurant in our area!\n\nIt is a bit pricey for a soup\/salad bar\/bakery buffet, but I think it is well worth it for the quality and selection.  Check your Sunday paper ads for a coupon.  It helps a bunch.\n\nThe pre-assembled salad creations are great and the make-your-own salad selection is likely the most expansive you've ever seen.  I would eat a salad like this every day if I had enough energy to prep the ingredients.\n\nBut it is their Yankee Clipper clam chowder that keeps me coming back, over and over.  It is a magical, creamy delight, with lots of clams and french-fry-sized pieces of potato.\n\nI like to grab a piece or two of their great parmesan focaccia to DIP (when nobody is looking, of course!).\n\nTheir chicken noodle soup is also very well done, with giant pieces of shredded chicken and chunky, homestyle noodles.\n\nThe bakery offerings are always excellent.  The cornbread and blueberry muffins definitely earned their \"black belts,\" and could compete and win with any bakery dojo!\n\nMy only food complaint?  Eh...  The pasta?  Seems to be just cooked noodles, tossed in a sauce in a wok?  For shame!  REAL macaroni and cheese is born from an oven!  You know, with the cheesy and CRUSTY top?

The venue is clean and has a very \"small pub\" feel to it (not unsimilar to Finns Mccool down the street). It's charming and cozy above all else. \n\nThe staff, from my experience, is very hit or miss. My first time here we had a very welcoming young lady who  served us really nicely. The second time, we had a young man who seemed both rude and aloof to basic conversational skills. There is nothing wrong with this, as I was not offended, however this needs to change if you expect to grow your reputation as a restaurant in the area. People will not always find this appealing (if at all). \n\nLastly, I wanted to touch on the food situation. We arrived after the lunch rush and it seemed that the staff needed about one hour to get wings and burgers ready; they had literally none. This is already a logistical nightmare for a restaurant that opens all day, but what really surprised me was the staffs inability to keep people here at all. I saw 5 parties of people come and leave while my lady and I decided to wait and ate fries to mull over the wait time.  This should not happen, in my opinion. Offer the guests a discount, complementary sides to wait, maybe a free drink too?.... But keep them at your venue! You've effectively made even a discounted sale into nothing and thus have shown those people your inability to serve food at certain times of the day, as well as the inability to retain customer satisfaction. In my opinion, the staff needs to learn a thing or two to elevate this venue from good to great, but the potential is there and I eagerly await their acceptance to this challenge","date":"2021-11-14 14:08:40"}

Tonight is its grand opening of the new extension of dining seats. To celebrate this event, I ordered the mangia house special of pasta specialities for the first time. I like the taste as usual. However, pasta is not homemade but by Barilla or supermarket noodles and tomato sauces. People who eat here are patrons and from the area. Customers talk to each other from across\/near seats and express satisfaction to mangia's service but most specially, it's food. And the best of all is the reasonableness of the food price. I hope though that if price change, it won't be drastic increase or would remain the same. The dining facility is quite simple, not elegant or sophisticated; it's a pizzeria style environment, but it works fine. Music is jazzy but too loud, and like the music you'll hear in chain Olive Garden. The lighting is adequate.

If you know me, there is no bigger fan of restaurants in general. I rarely write a bad review, I just don't say anything. This is something that needs saying and, there will be no photos this time.\n\nWe've been going to Mesa Verde for almost seven years now and at times considered it our favorite (V) restaurant on the Central Coast. The food was spectacular, the presentation was always equal to the food, the creativity and  thought given to each element of the eating experience was simply remarkable.\n\nThen, a while back, things started to fail and yes, I'm taking into consideration covid19. The quality started getting spotty, the service erratic, the ambience less inviting and the food, always the mainstay was inconsistent.\n\nWhile in Santa Barbara the other day we decided to take a chance and revisit for lunch. To be honest, we were simply stunned. The menu was much smaller and literally dirty, and the prices had jumped to an alarming degree. The vibe was so flat, the only welcome came from the busser.\n\nWe ordered the street tacos and the green bowl to share between us. The prices were shocking, both $22.00 nearly double the previous prices, the presentation was beyond lackluster with the tacos arriving on a plain white plate, not the wooden planks they used to use, no garnish, just three tacos which comes to over $7.00 each? \n\nThe bowl wasn't much better but we figured we bought it so eat it. Both dishes were so salty as to be nearly inedible. We mentioned this to the server who shrugged his shoulders and walked off. Water was never refilled, no dessert offered, not that we would have ordered one at this point and, they range from $13-14.00 each. \n\nTo say that Mesa Verde is no longer what it once was isn't even close to the disappointing experience. This place used to be a Mecca for vegans and non-vegans. The food\/service\/ambience\/quality was remarkable. Now it is simply sad, even the restroom was dirty. \n\nI prefaced these comments by saying I am fully aware that Covid19 has created countless problems for restaurants, some have made it and some have not. Some have flourished and some have not which is the case here. It would take a lot to get us to return or bring any of the many friends and family we've introduced to MV over the years.\n\nIt gives me no joy to say any of this but it's not my restaurant, I have been a very good customer for many years so not one of the malcontents here who never even ate at a restaurant and gave it 1 star for not getting in. Nope. \n\nI sincerely hope they wake up and give up the ghost or pull it together. Everyone deserves better.","date":"2021-12-06 02:09:01"}

The fire added just the right amount of smokiness to the sushi that was quite unique.  \nOverall an excellent place to dine on wonderful sushi and people watch!

My regular massage therapist, whom I'd usually see once a month, has been unavailable for a while and I was getting desperate. After four nights of insomnia and headaches due to my back and neck pain I called H & J Spa and was able to schedule a 90 minute deep tissue massage for the next day. I'm always a bit nervous trying someone new but the massage I got was fabulous and just what I needed.\n\nFirst the facility is very pleasant and clean, I felt immediately at ease. I was taken back to one of the massage rooms right away, given plenty of time to prepare, and I liked hearing a timer start at the beginning of the session (I've been to other places that cheat on time, one reason I avoid the big chain massage places that tend to overbook.) My massage therapist got right to work and used a variety of techniques to really work deep into my muscle knots, just the way I needed (and I could tell she could feel right where my worst spots were at). I really felt like I got the benefit of my full 90 minutes as she worked on everything from my scalp to my hands to my toes--with plenty of time on my aching back.\n\nTheir pricing is extremely fair and reasonable, and they will even give you a frequent visitor card where after 10 sessions you get one free. I will most definitely be going back and recommend them to others without hesitation!","date":"2021-05-15 21:15:34"}

I decided to try and get another estimate as that seemed quite high. As a result of looking into the situation with other people I purchased the cable part directly from a parts company. A friend believed he could replace the part. Although I received the part in December it wasn't until recently that he was able to do the job due to the weather. As a result it was just the cable apparatus that was needed not the motor. The cable apparatus cost $36.63. I feel that Conicelli Toyota was either trying to rip me off big time or they didn't want to be bothered with a small job of replacing the cable apparatus. Either way it says nothing good about this Toyota service location. As a result I will never go back there. They were not the happiest service people and I'm hoping to find a service department in my area that I can rely on.","date":"2021-04-06 19:28:58"}

I ended up buying a Jeep Cherokee and although I loved the car, I've regretted going to this dealership. I wish I had looked around more at the time and been more cautious because I without a doubt know I paid too much for it. A couple of days later, my sister decided to trade in her Jeep Wrangler, for another one. I liked our sales person, and everything seemed like it was going fine. \n\nWe both purchased the extended warranty on our cars, and we've both had immense issues with customer service. We were both supposedly given free oil changes for 5 years when we purchased the cars, but when my sister went into get hers, she apparently didn't have the sheets for it. They said they couldn't do anything for her because it could've been the case that she had \"either never been given free oil changes or had sold them to make some money.\" Absolutely ridiculous! They had no other way to pull up her information to see what was going on! I would think that a dealership of this size would have a better way of documenting these sorts of things to ensure that customers were covered should there be any sort of issue. She was denied the service, that she had been promised.\n\nI figured that I would have better luck since I found the oil change sheets in a folder I had received when I purchased my car. However, I also had issues with their service! Every time I booked an appointment either to do an oil change or fix a flat tire, they needed something different! Every person I talked to told me something different. I needed the sheet for the oil change, then I needed all the sheets for oil changes I had. For the first flat tire I had I didn't need to provide any paperwork to demonstrate that I had purchased an extended warranty, but then the second time, they wanted to charge me, and refused to look up my information on the computer (which another representative had previously told me was possible)\n\nThis month, my car was stolen, and my insurance recommended I contact the dealership to receive some of the money that I had put towards this warranty, that I won't get to use, and I've been completely tossed around. I've tried to get in contact with multiple people, but have yet to hear back. \n\nMy experience was so bad, that now that I am in the market for another vehicle, I am avoiding this dealership, and have decided to avoid Jeep all together! \n\nOverall, this dealership has some of the worst customer service I have ever come across. Avoid at all costs!","date":"2015-08-17 18:36:40"}

I was on a group camping trip up the road at Lake Cachuma and had this trail scheduled.  They told us it was a 6 mile hike and about 30 minutes into the drive over there I was already ready to go home. lol.  I am not a hiker and it was really hot so I was nervous about being able to hang, and the fact that I was at the mercy of other people was making me sweat.  \n\nLuckily, the swimming hole we found at the end of about a half mile of \"hiking\" was perfect and the group went swimming and after an hour or so they were ready to go back.  If I can make it out here again, I will try to hike the rest of the trail and find the other swimming holes.  \n\nBe prepared for the $10 fee to get into the park.  There will be a person there to collect it and give you a tag.  This spot is not run by the forest service, so the person is not official looking. There are several river crossings you have to pass just to get to the trail head, which can be driven through in a sedan, but probably better if you have a bigger car.  It's about 5 miles in from the point you pay and it is seriously beautiful.  Be careful, look for other cars and don't get distracted by the view, but do enjoy it!

The half chicken was $9.25 and it was four pieces. I was hoping one would be a wing (it was not). there was one small breast, two thighs and a drumstick. I consider this price to be very very expensive. I don't like the fact that you can't just order pieces of chicken. It's in halves and wholes only. I understand the whole \"more sustainable, more humane\" thing of not ordering multiple wings, but I would be more inclined to come here a lot if it wasn't a $14 brunch.

Avoid at all costs. I'm one of the unlucky ones who's mother insists on my brother and I taking these pics EVERY YEAR, so I think 32 years if these qualifies me to say this is the WORST company to ever get pictures through. We went to Westgate in Saratoga, CA on 12\/8\/21\n\n1) Santa insisted we grown adults sit on his lap which as grown adults, is just awkward, uncomfortable and unnecessary \n\n2) The photographer was deep into his phone, texting away at something and leaving my brother and I to sit on Santa's knees for longer than necessary. Despite us and Santa saying \"hello!\" \"Hi could you take the picture?\" And \"Excuse me?\" several times, we could get his attention and he moved behind the monitor on the desk to continue texting \"out of sight.\"\n\n3) Once we took the pictures we had no choice in identifying 1) which pictures we wanted or 2) which package we wanted. So they printed whichever pose they wanted in whichever size they wanted and proceeded to print out the largest most expensive package with the explicit intention of throwing out the ones we don't buy. What a waste of resources AND extra waste all that is completely avoidable. And WHAT!? Why can't we pick the best picture to be printed in the size we want??\n\n4) the ONLY options to purchase your pictures are what's pictured. So as someone who's done this for decades and only wants one 5\"x7\" to add to the many other 5\"x7\" Santa pics on her mother's wall. This is absurd. \n\nI STRONGLY do NOT recommend using these services ever again. I'd rather pay someone $40 to sit in a Santa suit and take a singular picture next year and moving forward. Don't waste your time or money here.","date":"2021-12-09 17:38:49"}

One of only 4 he's ever had at a \"salon\". Each time, they have come home regretting it... with a cut worse than anything our Flowbee can accomplish. \n\nThis time was the worst! Even though my husband informed April (the stylist) about our son's congenital triangular alopecia (a small bald spot on one side), she was not paying attention (she was apparently trying to train a new stylist across the room) and cut his hair WAY too short, exposing the bald spot. For the past few weeks, we have had to color in his little bald spot with a Sharpie marker, and 5 weeks later, his hair still has not grown long enough to cover it. Granted, they did not charge for the cut (thus the 2 stars instead of one), and my husband did not tip, he was so mad. But the poor kid is a teenager, and image is extra important at his age. Seriously, stylists, please pay attention! I'm sure you would not want to walk around all self-conscious, being stared at and talked about by your peers, yet this is what our son has had to live with for the past several weeks. \n\nI usually try to avoid negative reviews, and like to give out more positive ones, but I also think that we should all give our very best to the customers we serve, and to give them our undivided attention. I have thought about this for weeks, and have decided that this should be addressed.

Considering I dont even use the basketball, squash, yoga or pilates, I think there is something for everyone here - to an extent.  \n\nWhat is not so great about it is the HARD and i mean HARD selling that goes on among the trainers there.  When my wife joined, she looked for someone to just take 30 minutes to show her the equipment on the main gym floor.  2 minutes later, the trainer was trying to talk her into a $190+ dollar package for monthly training and how they don't really do one-off sessions.  It is like the $90-$120 you pay per month just kind of gets you in the door and there's little help beyond that.\n\nI also have a couple of friends locally that have heard me rave about the gym but I cant seem to get them in because the guest-passes are prohibitive. I get why they dont want people inviting herds of guests into the pool at summertime but this place would not lose money by letting me take a co-worker before 4pm to one of the morning classes that I take.  \n\nAlso, the LT Bucks are an absolute joke.  They were sold to us as being able to be used anywhere and after learning we cant use them in the Cafe (no big deal) we tried to sign up for a group class and turns out they aren't dollar-for-dollar.  So we wanted to use some of our LT bucks to shave off the price of a monthly premium class and apparently the LT Bucks only get you a free week of the class, so you get 5 weeks for the price of 4, not 4 weeks for a reduced price.  You are also locked into 2 months the moment you sign up for a class since each class requires 30-day notice to cancel.  Navigating the frustrating add-on services and the complete joke of a program known as LT Bucks is daunting. It is easily my least favorite part of the Gym.  I'm not a picky individual and trust me, it is a pain.\n\nIf you have some background in fitness and can make the most out of what is there, the gym is great - and there's a ton to offer.","date":"2017-10-03 19:54:59"}

I advised my salesperson (still new) that I was not a big fan of pointless repeated contacts and that if I wanted the vehicle after checking it out, that I would buy it.  Plain and simple.   All went well, I bought it.   1 month later and I've received no less than 10 followups from the dealership in the form of phone calls from my salesperson asking about referrals and hoping my vehicle is everything I wanted.  Mileage requests for extended warranty qualification, service work coupon mailers,  requests for reviews of my experience and to rate the followups.  I even get a phone call from my salesperson thanking me for my business and asking for referrals AGAIN- when just hours earlier I received a recall notice (salesman obviously oblivious to this because he doesn't even mention it).  \n\nYes, I agree it is important to follow up with customers.  But your number of soliciatations rivals those of Charter Spectrum.  If I need your services, I know where you are.\n\nStop calling me, stop sending me mailings for your service department. DO NOT CONTACT unless you are 1)Providing recall notice, 2)Sending me cash or check.\n\nStaff Performance Review.... NO\nSatisfaction Survey..... NO\nService requests.... NO\nExtended Warranty..... NO\nReferrrals.... NO\nProduct Satisfaction Review..... NO\n\nLeave Me Alone!\n\nTimes are changing folks, business practices need to keep up.  You don't build a loyal customer base by annoying the piss out of them. In 30 days, I went from being happy and content with my purchase and speaking highly of the company, to not wanting anything to do with you and telling everyone I know about how annoying you have become.  I love my car, but your ongoing bombardment of contacts makes me wish I made my purchase from a private seller instead.","date":"2019-04-17 14:49:18"}

The dealership told me the rear bumper was removed and therefore voided the warranty because there was obviously work done but not by a certified dealership. But NBD, that's my fault, I should have made sure that everything worked before I put pen to paper. The GPS SD was missing but the owner said to me (before I bought it) that one was ordered from the dealership and it was no problem. So I got the GPS card from them and installed it. DID NOT WORK! The dealership said the card SD card is married to the system and if you try to remove one from another car it will not work. I called Discovery and explained that there was an issue. I was told it's not their fault they had no idea there was work done the bumper(yea ok), I seen ur guys out back taking cars apart, so that's a lie! I at least wanted them to reimburse me the costs of fixing the GPS that also controlled other features.  Well my salesman said the card was bought from EBay (after the owner said it was ordered from the dealership) and if I wanted to, I could try to recoup by selling a SD (that is completely worthless) to someone else.

So if your reading this...look at the other reviews, the owner comments on great reviews but not bad ones. Maybe not because you can't please every customer, but more of they don't GAF about you once they sold u the vehicle.

So, after being disappointed with his bike that he bought on the internet about a year ago which broke almost immediately, he started researching bikes with close to 5 stars online.  We went to a place in Hammond near his college and had a bad experience with Gray Cat cycles.  We decided to look at bike shops either in or near the New Orleans area. We went to one bike shop Bayou bikes or something like that and my son told the lady there what he was looking for and actually she told us to check out Dashing.  She said that they moved to a new location so I called to make sure of the address.  The man who answered the phone was so polite and told me the address and we went there and was actually greeted outside the door because I told him that I couldn't  find the building but knew I had to be nearby. He helped my son right away.  My son purchased a Retrospect Harper in a matte olive green.  He purchased a kick stand which was installed there in the shop.  The bike totaled about $340.00 with the kickstand.  It is the bike of his dreams, and loves riding it.  It will be used mostly to get around the college campus.  I was so impressed as how knowledgeable and caring the staff was that I brought my bike to the store to purchase 2 new tires and to get a little tune up on it.  I was told that it may take around a few days to get it back or a week.  I got a call a couple of hours later that my bike was ready!!!!! People truly do make a difference.

I can do a cardio machine at any gym.  So he signed me up for two classes and I am meeting with Brooke the next day. Ok so I took two and then went back the next day just for the treadmill. Over I really like this gym. In comparison to other gyms I have checked out in Tampa this one is really nice. Will I join? Idk . It's not the convenient bit I think about it.","date":"2021-07-26 20:45:11"}

As good as Cajun\/Creole food may be, one just has the need to fill their belly with some greasy Chinese stuff every once in a while.\n\nThat being said, this spot hits the spot. The place is huge - probably to accommodate drunk tourists at night - and they're usually pretty busy, and the staff was pretty friendly as well.\n\nFor the price tag, the portions are pretty sizable. Even their lunch specials have more than average portion. Another thing I like about this joint is that you have the option to get the shrimp fried rice for your lunch menu - which I've never seen.\n\nAs for the important stuff - the taste, they're pretty average. Their general tso's chicken, of which I ordered it extra spicy, wasn't spicy at all, but it was on par with mediocre Chinese restaurants across the country. \n\nThe thing I shocked me about this place is the inconsistency from their menu description from the website. When you look at the menu from Grubhub, the plain fried rice is described as, \"Prepared steamed white rice with soy sauce, eggs, peas, carrots and green onions.\" Look at the picture of the plain fried rice I'd received - what a joke. There was not a whiff of the eggs, peas, carrots or green onions. They really need to work on the menu. Not only that, it tasted just like white rice mixed with soy sauce, and it tasted ridiculously bad. Their pork fried rice, on the other had, was pretty good. Mild, and lots of pork pieces.\n\nAlso, their baby corn that was in my bean curd went bad - it tasted awful.\n\nAll in all, I would go there again, as long as I stick to the stuff that I know already, like general tso's chicken.","date":"2019-03-14 02:16:02"}

When I got in to pick up my tray I was told by the manager I didn't pay for it .  I gave his the \" future order\" rcpt that was given to me and he said that doesn't prove I paid for anything. I don't have another $135 laying around. I went through my step-by-step with him so that he would understand that I had paid for it. He didn't budge. HE EVEN SAID HE REMEMBERED ME COMING IN AND SAID HE WAS SURE I DIDNT PAY.  Horror set it. The party was starting at 1 o'clock. I stopped by to pick up my order at 10:30.  An hour and a half later I begged and pleaded and tried to make sense but f it . The self proclaimed manager would make no iContact with me , told me he was going to put me out of the store if I continued. and claimed he was on the phone with the owner (while he giggled and smiled ) during his 30 minute call. I think he felt if he ignored me I would go away.  Customers came in and out and couldn't understand why I was there crying. I live nearby I've been a customer  on and off for 12 years.  \nMy son-in-law offered to pay AGAIN but I said I would not pay twice OVER MY DEAD BODY and this was unfair. It was a freaking tray of hoagies. COMMIN SENSE - Why would I stand there for an hour and a half  crying over a tray of hoagies if I was trying to steal it. Once the owner arrived I was told that was impossible IMPOSSIBLE , IMPOSSIBLE that I had paid for it. Also he said \"I heard you yelling while I was on the phone (so what?) He said That they don't take payments before pick up. That their cash register wouldn't even open on a preorder(?) (it opened fine when they took my money on Friday) \nI explained that I did not know what went on on their side of the counter but on my side for a fact I paid in cash. They were more than rude.  They were  belittling with lots of eye rolling , smirks, giggles, accusations , I was told Again and again and again that I was wrong. That I had not paid and I was not getting my hoagie tray.  I'm in disbelief. \nHonestly, I do not look or act like a thief. If I was a thief Why would I stand there in public and cry and insist and plead for an last hour and a half.  Can't they check the register recpts? What the hell. \n\nFinally at almost 1pm the owner reviews the video from friday !!! He was so rude and so sure of himself Had to REVIEW THE STORE VIDEO... are you kidding me ?? He called me in the back quickly and told me that he had proof that I did not pay. But for some reason he had stopped the video 5 seconds too early...( what the heck ) I asked him to continue the video for another 10 seconds and there it was, me paying in cash for my platter. The cashier putting my money in the register .  The self proclaimed manager seemed disappointed..as I came out ....( He was smiling when I went back to the owners excitement that he had proof)\nSeemed upset that I was correct.  let me remind you this was a hoagie tray it's what they sell day and night.  what did they plan to do with my hoagies if they ran me out of the shop????  Ruined my day. My night and left a huge imprint on me. Wasted my time- I felt like I aged 10 years.  I have NEVER EVER HAD THE INSINUATION THAT I WAS A CROOK BESTOWED ON ME   and I'm a 63 year old nice decent lady. Even after that it was like pulling teeth to get someone to help me get the tray to my car. The manager wouldn't touch it. All I can say is that I am still crying on the inside that they put me through this.  They were mad and weirdly mad.   \n\nThis has so UNSETTLED ME.. feels like I had a crazy bad dream. Two hours in their shop and they WOULDNT EVEN admit that it was possible possible they made a mistake .  They was no waivering that it was even remotely possible that I paid and they made a\nMistake.   No chance. Zero zip nada \nI AM SO MAD AT WHAT THEY PUT ME THRU JUST TO PROVE THEY WERE RIGHT when they weren't.  I had to ASK , yes ASK for an apology.  Not even a discount on my order for a 2 hour ordeal.  No one wanted to apologize.\nNot good or  honorable people.  I HOPE IT WAS WORTH THEIR TIME.  They forever lost my business and 15 of my local friends and relatives but that's nothing compared to how I feel about this. .  \nI'm still shaking .  I have a question.... If I was unable to prove that I paid .. what were they planning to do with the hoagies throw them away.? They need to learn a lesson here. Respect your customers have sympathy and consideration\nIf this from my hoagie shop at that point I would have just given the trade to the lady .. out of pity.

I also asked to refund the transfer fee since I committed to buying the van.  Here is how the purchase went:\n--I could not use my van as trade and get money off for the sales tax, which hurt.  I ended up selling it myself 4 months later for 1750.00. \n--They said they would not furnish new tires, that they passed their rigorous inspection standards on the initial checkout, which i picked out on the lot (to be fair, i am an ex mechanic.)\n--They would not refund the transfer fee.\n--They would not get us a new fob, again the KIA dealer was next door and they had a week to do it.\n--They would not get the roof crossover bars, a 350.00 expense, again available next door.\n--They said to go on the website for a paper version for the owner's manual on Helminc.com, not avail.  on KIA's website.  They state that they will reimburse you if you have to buy it.\n--Long story short, I bought the manual, showed them the shipping receipt and credit card charges since KIA would not give me the receipt in the package or when i called them (KIA) showed the Lady at the counter at CARMAX my proof of purchase, said she could not get me a 25.00 refund since it was not actually a receipt.

You can catch some beautiful views of the Benjamin Franklin bridge and some Philly skyscrapers. The inside is pretty well maintained, the lawn could use some geese poo cleaning, but with the lawn chairs available it was less noticeable after sunset!  \n\nThey have all kinds of fast food and drinks available, but be prepared to pay $$$$  . Beers start from 13 bucks but you get a $5 shots after that. So also be prepared to see a lot of drunk people lol.. \nthe fries there were pretty good! The bathrooms are functioning and neat. Not too long lines which was great! \n\nThe only sad\/mad experience was that they make you park at least 4 blocks away and that also cost 30$ . Then when I parked and got to the entrance they said I can't carry my bag, the bag only had a picnic blanket. So had to go all the way back to put the bag in the car and walk back again.

I didn't notice until about 3 months down the line how much hair the cleanup lady had cut out of my head!!!!!! Now sitting here months after with one side of the back of my head being totally uneven, i'm on the verge of just shaving the back off! -_- In the end I'm just glad I left before they tried putting the relaxer in my head without combing it first. One of the stylist said my hair was too thick and they would have to put the relaxer on before untangling it. Which is another reason I left. I'm no stylist but I know a relaxer should NOT be done without untangling it first!!! They would have had to cut most of my hair off if I didn't have enough sense and actually let them do it!

I don't know if it's still going on, but a couple of the employees at the Brewpub used to pull a scam to steal from customers.  About a year and a half ago, realizing that they had done this to my table on my way out the door, I tried to turn around to talk to a manager.  The person at the door insisted that I couldn't turn around without (re)paying their $10 cover charge.  I explained that I just wanted to go back in to clear up a bill issue with the manager, and they still refused to let me in.  I offered that, if they preferred, they could ask the manager to come to the door, at which point their security guard began to threaten me.  At that point, I figured that the small amount that they'd stolen wasn't worth the trouble of dealing with them.\n\nThe next day, I called to tell a manager about what had happened.  I would have thought that he'd be glad that someone told him, instead of just steering people away from the place silently.  When I finished the story, the manager asked \"Why the **** are you telling me?\"  So, I asked to speak to the owner.  The owner was audibly drunk and yelled \"You people all just want something for nothing!!! [A bunch of expletive laden nonsense.]\" (Mind you, I wasn't asking for anything.)\n\nAfter that, I, obviously, was reluctant to go back.  Some friends cajoled me into it a couple of weeks ago, though, and the experience was again poor.  My food came out cold.  I asked if they could reheat it but the waiter seemed unable to handle that on his own.  The manager came over and told me that he knew I just wanted my meal for free and that he wasn't going to do it.  In the end, my food was never reheated.\n\nThe owner of the Brewpub and some of his managers are truly abusive people.  You're online, so you can find plenty of more egregious stories of their misconduct for yourself.  As much as this place has going for it, do not risk going here.  Hopefully, after alienating enough people, they will go out of business and someone capable of treating others with basic dignity will take over that location.","date":"2013-10-06 02:30:18"}

Hourly rate is $150\/hr for 2 movers at 3 hours minimum, first time mover so I didn't question it. \n\n10:15am of move day comes around and other than a confirmation email 4 days prior, nothing. No call confirming them being on the way, so I decided to call-8 times-- to see what was causing the delay. No answer, okay, weird. Their location is 5 minutes from my house, so I drive there to speak to someone in person. 1431 Ivy Hill Rd location listed in Google and THEIR WEBSITE isn't even Sunshine Movers!! The business there is Public Storage, when I walked inside they had no idea who Sunshine Movers were. \n\nI nearly broke my thumbs calling my bank to reverse my deposit with them, no issues on their end. \n\n2.5 hours later after the maximum arrival time I get a text from Jay from Sunshine, which I did not consent to being contacted via text and after the text I called back and after a less than satisfactory apology he tried to proceed with the moving services.

I went to Sprintz because they had a great selection to choose from. I found the chair I wanted priced at $4000 on sale for $2299. I was lead to another chair by the sales associate talking about how great this chair was and that she had sold hundreds of these and never had any complaint. It did feel comfortable but seemed the foam in the cushions back and head were too soft and might be subject to detoriating quickly. The associate said I could just take it to an upholstery shop and have extra foam added.... Strange answer for this high end $3300 chair. I ended up placing an order after more discussion of how perfect and never one complaint after a few hundred sales on this item. I came home and started researching the chair and found many horrible reviews. I was astonished! I texted the sales associate that I wanted to cancel the order. I received the same sales pitch, finally agreed to change over to the first chair I liked but I said no, I want the order cancelled. I called my credit card company and they said we will do a 3 way call on Monday and insure this is credited back. My credit card was charged before I could drive home. It was credited back and I researched the so called $4000.00 chair they had on sale for $2299. Shocked again! I purchased the identical IMG chair on line for $1449.00 OTD delivered with white glove set up free. Their sale price was over retail. BUYER BEWARE!","date":"2016-11-20 15:26:57"}

Our waiter was extremely attentive and made sure no drinks went empty throughout the entire dinner. As others have mentioned, there is not a menu.  The waiter recites it, and it's pretty simple.  There is only one app, the onion rings.  Of course get them.  Onion rings were pretty tasty.  Huge pile and easy to munch on.  Seasoned well.  They were a shoe-string type which I enjoy compared to the thickies. These onion rings are pretty darn good.  4\/5.  In the end, they are just onion rings.  \n\nI got a wedge salad with homemade blue cheese dressing.  Not great.  I usually enjoy a good wedge, but I was underwhelmed.  Lettuce was chilled and served with a fat tomato.  My thought was, \"meh.\"  I ate about half.  2\/5.\n\nI had the ribeye medium rare, and it came out sizzling.  Charlie's definitely serves the sizzle with the steak. These steaks are more buttery than salty.  Unfortunately, I belong to the salty camp when it comes to beef.  Another issue was the marbling, little too much for a ribeye.  Meat was on the tough side, which translates into a chewy wad with ribeyes.  I continually salted my steak, but that's just me.  \n\nOverall, I will not repeat Charlie's.  There just isn't enough charm for the level of steaks they're serving.","date":"2017-03-31 02:24:00"}

However, it seems that every other new place that opens in Nashville is seafood! Lucky me! \n\nWe came here on a weekday afternoon for lunch lured by the idea of a sushi burrito which combines two of my favorite foods. The concept of Zushipoke involves customization for your bowl or sushi burrito. There is a counter where you can create your own or choose a specialty item and still add or change it to your liking. Both myself and my boyfriend got the monster sushi burrito. This comes with three proteins: krab (imitation crab), tuna and shrimp. It has cucumber, avocado, tempura pieces all mixed in a sauce before rolled up in rice and soy paper. I substituted the shrimp out for salmon and my boyfriend left out the avocado (something I would never do!) but asked for a tortilla instead of the soy paper wrapper. I assumed that by leaving the soy paper wrapper I'd be cutting the carbs but there was so much rice in mine since that had to adhere to the soy paper. The result was that my boyfriend's sushi burrito had more  protein and less rice so I wish I had done this substitution as well! The taste was great and it was served with a side of some sort of creamy mayo, wasabi and ginger. \n\nWe both enjoyed the food and the atmosphere was casual and clean. However, the workers were a bit slow and kept asking me to repeat my order. It is definitely on the pricey side too since it was $32 for two sushi burritos and 1 drink. Despite these couple of nit picky things it was overall a good experience.","date":"2018-09-22 01:08:57"}

Instead he attributed the wait to an unexpected party of 25 people. He took zero initiative and did not offer anything complementary or any discount on the bill. Maybe that's the norm for Datz.\n3. The food - Everyone in my party was too hungry to send the food back. However, the corned beef hash was oily and undercooked and the pastrami benedict was room temperature and way too salty. \nNever again!","date":"2015-05-04 00:06:56"}

I have struggled with whether or not I would speak publicly about what I experienced and have come to the conclusion that I would share my experience in hopes that no one else would be subjected to such treatment. Saks Fifth Avenue has left me disgusted at the behavior that was displayed by employees who were specifically hand picked by management and chosen to represent their brand!  Not only will I NEVER return, I will tell everyone that I know how this particular store treats their customers. On Saturday, April 6th at approximately 5:00 p.m. I was made to feel less than human as my race undermined my credibility in this high end retail store.  While I was not wholly denied access, I was treated differently. In many ways, this a microcosm of racial exclusions embedded in American society.  I am saddened and repulsed by the gross display of disrespect, disregard and overall rudeness that I endured at the hands of their employees. \n\nI will be graduating from a local university next month. I have worked hard and am proud of my accomplishments. As a reward, I decided to treat myself to a pair of high end shoes. Obviously, the first place that I thought of was Saks. My friend and I took the 20 minute drive to Frontenac to make the purchase. As soon as we entered the store (which was practically empty), the alarm activated. Being that we'd just walked in we both looked at each other with confusion and proceeded to walk to the shoe department. By now we notice two store clerks motioning to one another. While we were fully aware of their actions, knowing that we hadn't done anything wrong we continued to make our way to women's shoes.  \n\nThe female employee in the shoe department did not greet us. Meanwhile, I calmly and politely asked her if she could direct me to a particular brand of shoes. She then proceeded to ask me if I knew what size I needed. I explained to her that since the shoes are not American made, the size may be different. At no point did she direct us to an area with this particular brand. The saleswoman and I stood awkwardly face to face and in silence as she looked me up and down with pure disgust. While I was taken aback by her boldness, I chuckled slightly in disbelief. Did I smell? Was I not pleasant? Why was she interested in my appearance and not directing me to what I asked for?  She finally responds with a snide grin and says, \"Let me see what we have in the back!\" Now I'm really confused. You're checking to see what's in the back?  Other than me stating the brand of shoe that I was interested in, I stood patiently waiting to be directed to a display of shoes where I could choose what I wanted. What exactly was she checking for in the back? I didn't know exactly what I wanted, how could she? Maybe I was not privy to her physic abilities. That's it!  She was able to read my mind! The salesperson returns literally within two minutes and says to us, \"We don't have what you're looking for!\" Oh! Now we get it! No need to say more! As we walked out of the store we see the other two clerks motioning to one another again.  Extremely offended, my friend and I left the store shaking our heads in disbelief at what had just transpired. In closing, while I can't seem to forget the phrase, \"We don't have what you're looking for!\" out of my head, I still have faith in humanity. No one should ever have to feel belittled or less than because of the color of their skin. I suppose the folks at Saks didn't get the memo. Get on board people! This is 2019!","date":"2019-04-13 20:44:53"}

Now, I haven't had In and Out as yet. But put most burgers, gourmet too, the Shackburger is burger love for me. \n\nSo I only waited for the crowd's hustle and bustle to die down to have it after 2 years! And it did not disappoint. \n\nI love the OG - single patty shack burger. I get it with everything minus the bacon and onions. The patty is so succulent and flavorful. The cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato and the soft buttery bun balance the portion of the patty so well. I was hungry and I did order the double cheeseburger. The flavor, heartiness, and the feeling of satisfaction is like dopamine. It was very meaty. So in retrospect, I would get two single shackburgers because the flavors are just perfectly well-balanced. \n\nAlso, I did add peppers and it adds a sweet kick to the burger. Makes it a tad spicy and savory. \n\nFor me Shack Shack makes the best basic fries for the price point. It's crispy, thick and just rightly salted. And, then there is the shake. Now, I agree that for the price, the shake could be bigger. And there is a 50c charge for malt too, which I highly recommend as it elevates the milkshake flavor. We ordered the black and white and, it made it richer and creamier. I did wish the quantity was more. \n\nSo we ordered through the app, which Shack Shack recommends too. So the pick up is a separate counter and it was pretty quick and smooth. However, the caveat is the concretes were not available to order through the app and the shake flavors were limited. So we will have to revisit (gladly!) to try that.\n\nGiven that you can order through an app, they are open till 11 pm, there is plenty of seating in and out, all I am going to say is there is new kid on the block in the burger neighborhood.","date":"2018-09-03 20:27:39"}

The asparagus was beautifully presented and the broth was bursting with flavor and texture from the black walnut crumble. \n\nMy halibut entree was perfection. I was that girl who didn't offer a bite to my friends because I was hoarding it all to myself. Served with a warm potato salad, the halibut was just wonderful. I enjoyed my meal with glasses of txakoli, which was crisp and effervescent. \n\nAll of us were trying to be reasonably healthy but, when dessert appeared on the house, were weren't turning it away!

My family and I were here after the balloon races a few months back and stopped in for breakfast. The restaurant hadn't been open for too long, but I kind of got the impression that they were having a rough start that day. Our server was the nicest lady. Sadly she was not quick, but she was kind and we could tell she was working as fast as she could.\n\nHands down, my favorites are the potato pancakes, apple fritters - delicious.  The regular entrees are tasty, but the aforementioned are too good to pass up. The potato pancakes were crisp and not overly oily or heavy. The apple fritters were a first for me. I was expecting something along the lines of a huge doughnut like pastry and these looked more like dumplings. I was a bit skeptical about trying them, but they were tender, not overly sweet, and just way better than my doughnut idea. I wish I had taken a picture; I took for granted that BW has been open forever and someone would have taken a picture of them, but I didn't find one photo of these delectables - next visit! We also attended their special, Oktoberfest dinner, and opted to have the same server for our table again. We knew what to expect service wise, and again, she's just too nice and we couldn't say no to her when she invited us back.\n\nThe downside to Oktoberfest was that BW charges a fee just to have a seat. Sadly, I can't quote you the amount per person, but be aware that you pay a fee\/cover charge, in addition to your bill for food and beer. We had schnitzel and sauerbraten. I love jaegerschnitzel no matter what and had never tried sauerbraten. So I was pleasantly surprised by the sauerbraten; it wasn't overcooked and the sauce\/gravy was savory. I could see myself ordering this if I didn't want something breaded. I haven't had too much authentic German food, but I think BW has some great dishes that are homey\/comforting. Plus, their linzer cookies are butter delicious. \n\nDo not pass up the opportunity to try the food and sweets here.

I would definitely order breakfast takeout from there again.","date":"2017-11-09 19:55:01"}

I haven't been to too many brunches here in Indiana, largely because I spent almost none of my adult life here- the kicker is that I LOVE brunch. I love the ambience, the atmosphere, the idea of getting a relaxed start to the day and celebrating that start with good food and drink (because who needs hurried, pre-office breakfasts anyways), and of course, the bubbles.\n\nMy friends settled on mimosas while I can't turn down anything berry-flavored, so I settled on a sparkling lemonade (that I later shamelessly added some of their extra champagne to, of course). It was refreshing, spritely, and surprisingly, almost not sweet at all! \n\nWhile my croissant was a little too indulgent for my taste, the hashbrowns were absolutely divine, as were my others' friends orders of: Goose chorizo hash, bananas foster crepes, and a make-your-own omelet. \n\nThe menu has so, so many things I'm left wanting to try and with a new Downtown location adorned with some fabulous artwork of Bourdain, there's absolutely no doubt I'll be one of the first customers.","date":"2020-07-09 16:44:50"}

If your kid is a really great Little League baseball player, it can also be true that he would strike out every time if he were put on a Major League Baseball roster tomorrow.\n\nFor a fast-casual place to eat in the midst of a master-planned community, Twisted Sprocket is awesome. It would also be awesome if you put it in an airport. It's super convenient for those who live in Bexley. And it's a really nice surprise for any first-timer when they probably assume the quality of the food will be low-end banquet quality, at best.

We've tried bourbon chicken, loaded mashed potatoes, shrimp milano, meatballs, schnitzel, spaghetti and meatballs, pina colada cake and a few other things that I'm forgetting. I suppose the shrimp milano was my least favorite out of the group, but it was still a very solid meal. The bbq meatballs and loaded mashed potatoes was probably my favorite concoction.\n\nWe haven't participated in the cooking experience of what Dinner Done offers. With a newborn in the house, I don't foresee us having time to do that anytime soon, but maybe someday!\n\nThe only negative to Dinner Done is that I enjoy the meals so much that I end up eating well beyond a \"healthy\" portion every night. The portions are listed as for \"2-3 people, depending on hunger,\" so what happens every night is that I end up eating at least two portions worth, because what's left after we both eat never seems to be quite enough to save for leftovers. \n\nJust a heads up - these meals usually end up taking about an hour to cook + defrosting time.

If you are going with a larger group and want to make sure you're sitting with each other, be sure to identify that at sign up.\n\nThe instructor was very easy to follow. They had a nice selection of paint colors and stains. I think the hardest part was getting some of the more complicated designs pulled off of the (unsure of technical language) backing and then making sure it was centered on the piece of wood. The foam paintbrushes were also a little dingy, so it was a little difficult to get the final paint on there, but made out just fine using the side of the brush.\n\nThe first round of drinks are complimentary.

The gumbo had a good amount of heat,  and after my earlier gumbo fiasco at another restaurant, glad I got to sample some decent gumbo before I left New Orleans. \n   Tomahawk porkchop was huuuge and  cooked medium well spot on.

Ocean World is close to home and their sushi trays never disappoint. They are always so consistent with their food! The trays always look the same (we even ordered two one time and they look very identical) which I like because I know I can trust my next order to be as great. I love the variety if nigiri they give you and you can choose between three sushi rolls (or four - the fourth one has an extra charge) to order with the 22 pieces of nigiri. We almost always order the soft shell crab o2 roll because we like to have a balance of cooker and raw fish. As a side, you can choose between miso soup or side salad (they give you two so you can choose two misos or two salads or one of each). \n\nI'm leaving out one star because of their pick up process wasn't a fun experience.

Kilimanjaro restaurant is located in West Philly in the University area.  \n Killamanjaro is located in a strip mall with free parking,  however the lot was full and I had to park around the corner.  Even though I parked down the street and around the corner, immediately upon leaving my car I could smell the unmistakable spices of African food! On my way to the restaurant, I went into what the army calls a quick step.\n The aroma was intensified inside and I sat down in a quaint little dining room with high hopes. The server was a very nice young lady who brought me the menu. After looking over the menu it became clear to me that this was food from the country of Senegal, which is puzzling to me because Kilimanjaro is in East Africa.\n I had already tried many of the items before at other spots,  and one dish called Yassa Philly caught my eye. First I want to tell you that I never order anything that seems out of place and not authentic on a menu. To me its like ordering a Philly cheesesteak in Cheyenne Wyoming- You are rolling the dice!\n However I did not listen to that voice, and I sure wish I would've! \n I ordered the Yassa Philly with beef, the presentation of the dish was beautiful. The plating of the meal was excellent, the rice, the vegetables and the Beef smothered in a spicy savory Yassa sauce. The rice was unmistakably African and the vegetables were cooked to perfection. But when I try to taste the beef, I couldn't cut it even with a steak knife. The cut of beef was so tough, with so much tended and gristle, my American teeth were no match for it.\n Just about then the server walked over to my table and asked how the food was. I told her that the beef is very very tough, she just nodded and walked away.  I really wanted to like this place, but how can you ignore a complaint like that and walk away? \n Even though the beef came out caveman style, I would like to give it another try and stick to my old conventional criteria for ordering food.","date":"2014-01-13 18:39:02"}

I can't wait.  I seek them out, I savor them, and I really just plain enjoy them.  Part of my love affair with bagels is that I am a true carb head.  It's pretty sick how much I love carbs. But I digress. As a result of being a carb fiend \/ ny bagel snob, I feel like I know a good bagel when I have one. I recently stopped by South Street Bagels in an attempt to enjoy a good bagel. I really wanted to like them, but in the end, while their bagel was GOOD, I still think I prefer Four Worlds Bakery and the NY Bagelry out on Haverford Ave, even to some extent, Spread in Rittenhouse Square. \n\nHere's why: \n\nI went there early on a Sunday morning while running errands, really hoping to be in and out fast.  The place had a significant line, and they were NOT moving people along pretty quickly.  In fact, they had a number of people standing behind the counter NOT helping customers.  Secondly, the bagels, while many in variety, and all looking great and warm and coming out constantly (implying that they were in fact very fresh), were OKAY.  I ordered a sesame seed bagel with lite vegi cream cheese, instead got a sesame with plain cream cheese, and it was just plain okay. It wasn't fantastic.   It was a decently made bagel, but there was SOMETHING off about it.  I bought two, so I got to try it again the next day.  Toasted, it was good.  But again, not great.  It was a LITTLE too tough for my liking, and though they had just come out of the oven, they weren't nearly as soft and yummy as I had hoped they would be.  They also seemed to be too dense, and just not quite delicious.  \n\nVerdict: it's a good bagel place to get a good bagel fix.  A tad overpriced, and the service is a little slow (if my experience was at all typical), and just plain okay. \n\nThere are other bagel places around \/ in the city that I prefer.","date":"2011-12-25 21:47:37"}

Arrived around 8:30am on a Friday and there was a line wrapped around the building. We stayed, we waited, we ate and it was worth it.\n\nOpened from 7am-3pm. From my understanding there's always a line. Looks long but moves fast. Once you are in the building it goes quick. You have plenty of time while you are waiting in line to look at the menu. Your order at the counter and then they seat you with a number. \n\nThings to note: \n1. Mimosas are made with fresh squeezed oj and served in a highball glass which justifies three $12 per mimosa.\n2. The Princess is \"hot chicken\" style, not actual Nashville hot chicken. It's delicious and pretty mild.\n3. Not sure what's special about the iced coffee but it's the best I've ever had. I had it black (no cream or sugar) and it was perfect.\n4.

Me and my old lady kept saying that to each other. So we came here Easter Sunday after church and it was pretty packed but we were seated in less then 10 minutes. They has their normal menu and an Easter Brunch menu as well. I ordered the Croque Monsieur with a side of tomato soup and my old lady ordered the Beef Angus with coleslaw. Now lets get to the food. \n\nCroque Monsieur- This bad boy is like a baked ham and cheese sandwich. It came with Havarti cheese, garlic sourdough bread, with mozzarella on top with a side of mustard and some delicious fermented veggies. The natural uncured ham went perfectly with the garlic sourdough bread. The veggies were also amazing and I loved how pickled they were as well. \n\nTomato Soup- Usually I don't order soup but I was reading the numerous of reviews and everybody was talking about the soup. So I got the tomato soup and boy am I glad that I did. The soup was sooo darn good! I dunno what I was thinking never ordering soup lol. It even had a little spicy tang which I enjoyed. \n\nIf you haven't been to this restaurant then do yourself a favor and come! You wont be disappointed, trust me!","date":"2019-04-22 22:55:16"}

I eat like a child, so I wasn't expecting many items that would appeal to me, but boy, was I wrong!\n\nI started with a bowl of their home-made tomato soup and WOW, was it good.  Creamy with chunks of tomato, perfect spices, accompanied by sourdough bread.  It was so big, I should have just gotten the cup.\n\nFor my entree, I opted for the 1\/2 turkey Reuben sandwich, with Cole slaw.  The rye bread was perfectly toasted and the turkey was juicy and moist.  Add the perfect amount of 1000 island dressing, sauerkraut and plenty of melted Swiss and you have food bliss!  The accompanying Cole slaw was crisp and tasty; however, I prefer more dressing on mine as this seemed dry.\n\nThe other items ordered at the table included the chips\/salsa (fresh and home-made), the lemon\/artichoke soup (which was rich and tasty with a little tang from the lemon), the salmon sandwich, on Ciabatta bread, which was so huge it had to be attacked with a fork and knife!  Hubby said the side of Quinoa was the best he'd ever had.  Also appearing at our feast were the Elvis Liege waffle (which was an amazing improvement on a traditional Belgian waffle, and I loved the history about this waffle provided on the menu) and a Paleo bowl, which was HUGE and looked way too healthy and grown up for me, but the one who ordered it ate every bite!\n\nGood service, a little slow on drink refills and forgot some stuff we asked for during the meal, but overall, not bad for a busy mid-day rush.\n\nStop by if you're in the mood for some seriously good tasting food - even if you eat like a kid, I promise you'll have trouble deciding on just ONE thing to eat!","date":"2013-12-30 07:32:21"}

So I originally found KAHA through Groupon. It was a great deal so I thought I would give it a try because I really love group fitness classes and I saw they teach a variety of Les Mills classes here . I belonged to Planet Fitness at the time and it wasn't really giving me what I was looking for . \n\nOne thing I will say about KAHA that sets them apart from other gyms is you feel WELCOME when you walk in the door . I have been to other gyms where it's like you are a peasant off the street who dared to enter their precious gym .. not the case here ! The owner, Monica, and the rest of the staff really make it a point to let you know they are happy you are there . \n\nAfter my Groupon expired , I ended up taking the plunge and signing up for a membership here ! And let me tell you, I have not once regretted it. I honestly have gained much more than I ever thought I would . KAHA has introduced me to two extremely important aspects of my fitness\/health life that I was missing : strength training and nutrition . I knew I didn't have a clue what to do with weights ... but honestly I thought I had a pretty solid grip on nutrition . Turns out I did not . Haha! I thought of carbs as my enemy (which is not true I found out!) and I was getting less than half of the protein that I should've been . Who knew ? Although I was skeptical at first , with proper training in strength and nutrition I have seen incredible changes in my body. In 2.5 months I lost 5% of my body fat and gained almost 3 pounds in muscle!! I'm looking forward to continuing my routine and seeing how much more I can accomplish, especially knowing that the owner and the instructors\/coaches are genuinely happy to help in any way possible. \n\nTakeaway: I would HIGHLY recommend giving KAHA a try","date":"2019-01-11 17:17:15"}

There are ample parking spots available in the private lot that it shares with the other businesses that they are in the strip mall with.\n\nThere food menu is compact, but still has something for everybody. There are salads, quesadillas, burgers, fish, wraps and chicken. I got the Sloppy Joe with fries and their reuben egg rolls as an appetizer.

She had a dark short bob haircut and I believe she was wearing glasses. I honestly wasn't going to leave a review until I happened across their Instagram account today. Their post yesterday explained why they as a small business are requiring masks by their patrons, even though there is no mandate, and asked people to #bekind. I think they need to practice what they preach. With our city growing and so many new people coming to the area, you think they'd be kinder and more welcoming.\n\nI will NEVER go to this place again, masks or no masks, solely because of  their hypocrisy. I don't think they can afford to continue with the bad behavior . The locals can only keep you in business for so long. It's the new people in this growing city that will keep you thriving, but not with their ugliness. \n\nSadly, I don't see them staying in business for much longer.","date":"2022-01-17 00:46:38"}

Recently his doctors recommended he start medical marijuana, and it has been a huge help to him.  As in, just short of transformative.  It's not a fix-all, but it has given him enough of an improvement to come off some medications with scary side effects, and overall he's in a better place.\n\nI will also say the cannabis you get in the dispensaries is not what has been available illegally.  The quality is higher, more consistent, and very highly engineered, with different combinations of THC and CBD for different issues, along with different formulations.  I am impressed.\n\nUnfortunately, the combination that has been working best for the NMT also works really well for lots of other people, so it's in super high demand.  This means I basically stalk the different dispensaries, looking for it on their 'menus'.  This is how I came to be at Cure as they opened up one morning.  \n\nThis is controlled access, as expected, with a sleek, modern feel.  I was greeted warmly, my card taken, and pretty quickly headed back to the secure dispensary area.  One of their employees, super nice and also knowledgable, helped me with the strain I was looking for and also another that might work about as well (it does, not 1:1 match, but it will do when the preferred strain isn't available).  \n\nThe place is clean, bright, the staff is approachable and friendly and knowledgable.  Cash Only - all the dispensaries are cash only, if you didn't know that.  Why? For the same reason you can't use your AMEX to buy from the street - cannabis is still (for now) illegal at the federal level, and banks follow that set of laws.  They have an ATM on site, there's also a Bank of America branch on the same block and a Bryn Mawr Trust branch right across the street, so you have options to possibly avoid fees.  \n\nOf course I'm going again, when the menu shows his best-working strain, but I'd also go because it's a pleasant experience to be there.","date":"2018-11-21 18:31:45"}

It's a small establishment located on the corner of a shopping plaza and from the first look at it, you would not expect for this place to have a wide menu option. Their food ranges from Vietnamese dishes such as pho, vermicelli dishes, spring rolls, etc. They also have shumai, pork buns, and tarp buns. They offer boba and of course, donuts! \n\nI ordered the #1 which comes with rare beefsteak, beef flank, beef tendon, tripe and meatballs. The serving size was bigger than I expected which was also worth the price of 8.95. Definitely getting a bang for your buck with the amount of food you get. I was very disappointed with the taste though. The broth was very bland and watery. The bean sprouts that come on the side looked a little old and it tasted how it looked when I put it into my pho. We also ordered the pork and shrimp spring rolls which were good, along with their dipping sauce. They have a thick peanut sauce which was very yummy. \n\nWe also ordered pork and shrimp shumai. It had more flavor to it for sure and I did like the dipping sauce that it came with. One order had 10 pieces which was a good amount. It was however a little on the salty side but it was still good. \n\nLastly, we ordered the sweet & sour chicken and fried rice. This was also a decent item. Some of the pieces of chicken were a little cold which was very unpleasant and the fried rice was lacking some flavor. \n\nI'm not sure if I just came on a bad day, but I did leave pretty disappointed with the outcome of our meal.

He said I needed a new unit (of which I agree) and he had a deal on some. I arranged for them to replace both my \"moldy\" air handler and compressor. My first mistake was not making sure he was replacing the unit with a heat pump which when we built the house is what was installed. My fault for not making sure I was getting what I thought I was. The real rub was the people who came out really did a crappy job installing it. Every tech that has come out since looks at the system is amazed at the install. For example there is a small compartment in the unit for the excess electrical wires to go into. They left them hanging out loose \"to make future servicing easier\" so there was a massive tangle of loose wires just hanging out (I put the in a blue electrical box mounted to the unit). The unit also isn't properly leveled.  The unit should tilt slightly down towards the drain pipe to facilitate draining. Instead it is tilted 1\/4\" the opposite way so it doesn't drain right. There are also dips in the drain line where it wasn't supported correctly. It is visibly crooked and the supports were not adjusted so it appears to be sagging. One thing that also dawned on me is a permit was not pulled for the work which would have necessitated an inspection. \n\nThree lessons learned that apply everywhere:\n1. Make sure you are clear in what you want and make sure that's what you are getting\n2. Make sure a permit is pulled. The process is to protect the homeowner.\n3.

This is a large restaurant, and can feel cavernous when it's empty, but the hostess sat us on the patio, which is more intimate. Our usual starter at a seafood restaurant here is oysters on the half shell, and these were very good. One of my pet peeves here in New Orleans is getting oysters with muddy shells. I'm really not a fastidious gal, but when you put that shell up to your mouth and get a bunch of dirt? Yuck. Not only were these oysters great quality, but someone took the time to scrub them and shuck them properly, so there we no bits of shell. I appreciate that, and will return for more.\n\nIt being a Monday, I had their red beans and rice, which were good. Not the best I've had, but serviceable. I also tried the fried oyster salad, which was petite but tasty, with a really nice Dijon vinaigrette and perfectly fried oysters.

The smell of fresh boiled seafood permeating the room greets you as you enter.  There is about a dozen wooden tables scattered around the small room.  A TV at one end for those inclined to watch as a radio station plays music.  I like the fried shrimp platter.  Maybe one day I'll explore the menu further.  The corn and shrimp bisque is nicely flavored.  My wife likes the eggplant Harahan, a combination of eggplant medallions and crab cakes.  On the most recent visit she shared a boiled seafood platter with our guest.  There was an amazing amount of food on it for the price ($25); a pound of snow crab legs, 4 medium crabs, a pound of shrimp plus potatoes and ears of corn.  They had a great time eating it.  Beer and wine only, plus soft drinks.  In addition to the main restaurant, the newly remodeled Oyster bar is now open.  And there are tables outside.","date":"2012-11-08 03:47:27"}

Let me review the place floor by floor:\n\nI used to swim, and the pool is a standard Olympic-size one with ordinary showers, locker rooms, and towels. Nothing to see here.\n\nThe first floor has truly benefited from the renovation, the ellipticals and treadmills are all packed and for good reason. I personally prefer the erg machines, but they could always add a couple more.\n\nThe second floor multipurpose room with the large mat (for stretching and core exercises) used to be my stomping ground, but it's always too packed for my liking. Also the punching bags disappeared at last visit, and the plyo boxes are a little uneven. In addition, the basketball courts are insufferable in warm weather...ventilation please!\n\nI'll skip a floor and talk about the fourth. It's perhaps the best kept secret about the gym. Once up the stairs make your way past the Zumba class and you'll find a pretty awesome iron gym with pull-up bars, kettlebells, and even a heavy rope. There's also a single erg machine, cardio machines, and a dumbbell rack. The secret's out.\n\nFor all the Penn kids out there, make the most out of this campus gym. You're already paying a recreation fee, might as well enjoy it and get the bod you want.\n\nOnly gripes: crappy hard-to-open lockers and a dearth of towels.","date":"2014-05-27 06:49:15"}

This is my preferred way to dine always, I want to optimize the things I'm able to taste without getting too full so family style is always the preferred method for me, but others at the table are picky so they were hesitant. Since it came at our server's recommendation, we went for it. \n\nWe ordered the crispy brussels and crab croquettas to start. For our mains we had the Arroz Con Pollo, Ropa Vieja, and a Cuban Roasted Pork dish. Everything was delicious, especially the chicken. The brussels were a hit, with two anti brussels sprouts eaters at the table.\n\nThe cocktail menu was extensive, with lots of great tequila and mezcal options.

We were referred to this shop from USAA insurance and we are so extremely disappointed in our experience at this business. We would absolutely NOT recommend Tri-County Auto Glass Experts to anyone who values their vehicles or their time. If I could give negative stars, I would. \n\nOn his day off, 11-8-2021, my husband took my car to Tri-County Auto Glass Experts get a simple windshield replacement. Unfortunately I was unable to go as I had work that day. When it was time to pick up my car, my husband was shocked to see that my right front tweeter speaker had been knocked out and wires were exposed. My husband was FaceTiming me so that I could see what was going on, and when he brought up the damage to the employee, Juan, my husband was berated and he was called a liar! Juan became defensive, argumentative and insulting and claimed that the speaker was already like that. This is completely false and extremely insulting. It had NEVER been like that. It had never even been slightly loose. My husband also discovered additional paint chips around my windshield and scratches to the interior. To add insult to injury, Juan claimed he never even opened the car door at all to install the windshield (this is in fact 100% not possible so it's evident Juan is the liar). Juan and the other employee there continued to act condescendingly toward my husband, called him a liar, and forced him to leave the establishment before anything was resolved and without getting a proper receipt with proof of their so-called lifetime warranty. \n\nBefore coming to Yelp, we tried working with this business to give them a chance to rectify the situation or at least treat us with some decency and respect. In a disgusting turn,  the business owner, James S. Budow, has now gone so far as to accuse us of \"scammy\" behavior - all because my husband was FaceTiming me to show me the damage. So watch out if you want to take pictures or videos of your cars while you're there, you will be labeled as a scammer and be called a liar. The owner, James S. Budow, also told us that he encourages his employees to get their work done quickly so they can close up early and go home. This was the excuse in response to us questioning why they made my husband leave and why our car was damaged. The employees wanted to go home early. So if you want to be treated decently and have your car taken care of properly and not be damaged, go somewhere else where they will not be cutting corners to clock off early.\n\nThis business advertises \"lifetime warranty\" on their work and glass they install, however after our experience it is very clear that this is nothing more than a deceptive business advertising practice. The owner, James S. Budow, and the employees at Tri-County Auto Glass Experts do NOT respect people, much less military veterans, and they do not respect people's vehicles.

I had made this appointment 3 weeks in advance, and I had informed them that I would be waiting for the car. I included my cell phone number, and my e-mail.  I took my car in for the scheduled appointment in the morning, and when I walked into the service department, there were 3 people behind the counter, but no one showed interest in assisting me (that should have been my first clue of the horrible service to come). I was then assisted by service consultant Mercedes Vega. She wrote me up, and told me that I will have to drop the car off, but I mentioned to her that I specifically stated to them that I will wait for the car when I filled out the appointment online, and that they had my phone # as well as my e-mail in case that was not possible, but they never contacted to to let me know that I could not wait. She still insisted that I could not wait in the waiting room due to covid, at which point I informed her that I will not wait out in the street for a couple of hours until the car was done.  She finally agreed to have me wait in the waiting area but with an attitude.\nAfter about a couple of hours of waiting, she comes in the waiting room telling me that I have a bad leak in the rear differential, as well as a couple of other issues. She made it sound that it was a heavy leak and it was urgent to fix, so I agreed to have  them to fix the differential leak. After waiting for another hour and a half, I decided to go and find out about the status of the work. She was on the phone, and when she saw me, she said that the car was not ready, and when I tried to find out as to when I will be finished, she started yelling at me telling me that she's very busy, and that she has no time to check, but it should be another 20 minutes. The question is: Why did she tell me that I had this urgent issue to fix if they did not have the time to do it. She knew that I was waiting, and she should have asked me to make another appointment. In any case, I went back to wait, and finally, she tells me that the car was done. Now here is where the Faulkner Nissan rip off comes into play ( besides the bad attitude, and the yelling at the customer ). They charged me $49.95 for the Emissions test even though I was \"emissions exempt\"  and $151for fixing the rear differential leak.\nSince that day, I have noticed that my rear differential fluid now is leaking in my garage, which I have not noticed before I took my car to Faulkner Nissan, so not only did they charge me $49.95 for exempt emissions, and $151 for supposedly fixing a rear differential leak, but now, it is really leaking where it was not before.\nIt would be nice if any manager at Faulkner Nissan who gives a damn about customer service to inform his service people to never yell at customers, but to be courteous.\nI only wish that the Pennsylvania consumer protection office would look into Faulkner Nissan's deceptive and fraudulent business practice.","date":"2021-11-11 16:32:45"}

Although this is a very expensive project, I feel that if any issues arise I will be able to call them and get an immediate response as I have in the past with my eight windows that they replaced about six years ago and a sliding door they replaced two years ago.","date":"2016-08-17 01:16:04"}

There was no salt and pepper on the table and we had to ask our waitress twice for them. \"Oops I forgot\", she said with a smile (basic table items).

Adam, the manager, helped me find a bed that met my needs, walked me to a few options and gave me a great deal on a mattress and box spring that wasn't going to break my bank account if I financed it. \n\nFor me the best process was that they offered free deliver for the bed, and were able to haul my old bed away with no charge as well. That was a great sale for me. \n\nAdam was very knowledgeable on the beds and how other customers have experienced them. I also really liked that it's a family owned and local business, and they were able to bring the price down to the lowest they could sell it for. \n\nHoping that the mattress brings me great nights of sleep in the coming years.","date":"2017-09-21 13:16:14"}

To be honest, I hate the decor. It's pretty minimal, both in color and artwork. The walls are white and wood paneling. The booths are charcoal grey, and there's a few dull gold accents. For me it's a cross between stark and bleah, but I'm sure someone will tell me it's tasteful and contemporary. I halfway suspect it's so you'll decide to take your food to go.\n\nBUT, atmosphere isn't nearly as important as flavor, and do these flavors ever pop!! I had the vanilla bean latte, (robust) and the Sloppy Joe. The Sloppy Joe was actually a tidy and delightful sandwich with beans, tomato and avocado. The thing that struck me was how delicious the bread was. I could taste the multiple grains and it was so soft and fresh. Nice decent portion too with a few tortilla chips. \n\nMy sister had the falafel, and I can see why she enjoyed it. Again, very fresh, with singing flavors. She also had a mango mojito smoothie. THAT was interesting! Not my thing, but I swear it tastes like summer. Like sunning in your backyard next to the freshly mowed lawn, drinking something cold and fruity.\n\nDessert was a chocolate chip cookie for me, and an Eat More square for my sister.

The customer service is the worst of the worst. \n\nComplain #1: I scheduled a couple day spa which included the use of the jacuzzi hot tub, a couples massage and lunch. The hot tub was the first service we received. The water was ridiculously hot. I am the type of person that loves a hot shower but the water in the tub was almost boiling hot. The receptionist didn't know how to use the remote control to control the bubbles, the tub had to be basically emptied and then filled up. By the time they fixed everything it was time for the massage. The special surprise that I had planned for my boyfriend was pretty much ruined. \n\nComplain #2:  I became a member of the spa and selected the the VIP package membership.\n\n I went to go get a oxygen facial. When I went to check out, I was charged full price (minus 15% with my membership discount) for the oxygen facial. \n\nI asked the receptionist why I was being charged full price when an oxygen facial falls under the advance skin care which is part of my membership. The facial should have been $79.\n\nThe receptionist explained to me that the hydra facial AND the oxygen facial are excluded. \n\nOn the pamphlet that was provided when I signed up for my membership, it only describes that the hydrafacial is excluded NOT the oxygen facial. \n\nThe receptionist explained to me that those are old pamphlets and the new ones haven't arrived yet. \n\nThey provide the wrong information to the clients and then expect them to pay the full price. \n\nComplain #3: with my VIP membership I get a glass of wine and I can use the sauna. Everyone I have called to make an appointment I request to use the sauna prior to my massage and every time I arrive to the spa the sauna is NOT turned on so I have to wait for the sauna to get hot. I'm NEVER offered a glass of wine, I always have to remind them to give me one and the last time I had an appointment I asked for a glass of wine and the receptionist never brought it to me. The lack of detail is unbelievable. It's called a VIP membership because that's how your clients should be treated. \n\nComplain #4:  I requested to cancel my membership. I was going here for approximately 6 months and was trying to give it a chance but the customer service is just awful. The blonde lady that is usually the receptionist seems like she's so lost sometimes and hardly know the answer to anything. \n\nI sent an email to the email address on the website requesting to cancel my membership. I received a response that the cancellation has been received and the last payment would be in August.\n\nWhat happens at the beginning of September.... I get charged for the membership that is supposed to be cancelled. I'm not mad, I know errors happen. I reply to the email and ask if there was an error because I was charged. 3 days later I still have no response to I call the spa ( this was on a Saturday). The blonde lady that's always lost picks up, I explain the situation, of course she can't help me and tells me that she will have Bianca call me. \n\nThe following Tuesday comes around and I still haven't heard from the spa so I call again. The blonde lady answers the phone and says that Bianca isn't there but she will be in the office the next day and she will have her call me. \n\nToday is Sunday and I still haven't heard back from the management staff. \n\nIt is unacceptable that a customer needs to wait over a week to receive a response. Either the staff needs to be trained on how to handle these situations or Bianca, the owner, needs to be on top of checking emails and returning phone calls. \n\nWith so many options in tampa I would highly advise you to spend your money at another spa.","date":"2019-09-16 03:09:46"}

It just seemed so far-fetched to me!  Add that to the fact that I'm a first generation  Italian and can cook just about any dish you can think of, and dining in an Italian restaurant in a strip mall next to WW just didn't excite me. SO when a friend invited me to lunch  at Il Melograno, I was too curious not to accept!\n\nWell, much to my surprise, the restaurant is quaint and understated in its decor. The owners are the servers and are very personable! And the food!  Oh, the food was just like it was when I was growing up. The salmon entree that I had was perfectly crispy on top with a lemon butter & caper sauce and served with spinach, garlic & EVOO. Bella!  \n\nDefinitely a place to try!","date":"2020-01-30 02:33:24"}

Sadly, Pod falls way short. Their prices are high for the portions and location in University City, but I am slightly willing to overlook that because I truly did enjoy the food. However, the restaurant itself is just dirty and I found that so off-putting simply because of their high prices; they really need to pay better attention.\n\nFor starters, my sharing plate was dirty with dried, caked on food. Waiter promptly replaced it, but why set the table with that to begin with? We were seated in a window booth that is decorated with little round colored vents-one glance and you could see the vents were full of dust. We looked up to see the dusty\/moldy vents lining the ceiling which didn't make us feel better. Cut to the neighboring chairs that had food dripping down them from previous guests. The tables and chairs are white which I understand is not very forgiving, but this restaurant builds itself upon its aesthetic, decor and ambiance and there really isn't an excuse for such eyesores.","date":"2019-04-08 15:33:49"}

I was served by this woman who gave me a two chicken entrée of the only indian chicken you can have in Isla Vista. I will tell you right now that it was delicious.

The tiny salad that they ask whether or not you want is decent but small just as well. \n\nNaan Stop is a great place to try Indian food or to open your palette to a new type of food. If you are courageous and want to try something different, give it a try as it is actually decent. A little pricey but worth it considering there is nothing near by that compares.\n\nP.S. Do not play Snappa or any type of drinking game before or after eating Naan Stop. Not a good call. I just played two games and my stomach feels like shit. But it's still good food! Also, I am drunk.

We got to the hostess stand outside and were put on another waitlist, not in front but in back of other people who had arrived. I asked about our position in the online waitlist and the hostess said that she didn't check that list and didn't seem interested in honoring our position in line.\n\nI have only ever eaten outside here so I had no idea that there was a seperate host station inside for indoor seating. The hostess outside didn't even bother asking us if we wanted indoor or outdoor seating.\n\nThe hostess asked several times how many people in our party even though we were all standing right there. I only had my daughter with me (one child) and she asked how many children menus we needed. As we were seated at our table she ran away as I was asking her for a highchair, ignoring any other requests we may have had. I had to wait for our server to come to the table to request a highchair.\n\nOur server was very nice. He let us take our time with our meal and enjoy each other's company.\n\nAt the end of the meal, my parents were taking us out to dinner so they were going to pay. I offered to buy walking drinks for the Ghost Walk so I went to the bar to order. The bar was super packed so I saw our server and asked him to start a new bill and order the drinks. He did and I paid right away since we were at the computer already. Turns out, he charged me for the entire $234.54 bill!

She does a fabulous job of marketing and advertising her jewelry on tv as it's literally all she wears. I also think the minimalist style is very trendy and likable by most, so she's really doing a great job of making people want to buy it. K. Now that that's said, if you're like me, once you decided to go online and actually purchase some pieces, the prices probably shocked you, right? I could NOT believe the prices that the jewelry retails for.  It's cute stuff but NOT that great. You have to take into consideration how simple the designs are. And none of it has any special stones or anything so WHY on earth such the steep prices? I own a lot of Kendra Scott and they are known for their unique stones so I get it why their prices are what they are. More on that comparison in a little bit.  So, I decided I would never purchase any UJ jewelry until it was majorly discounted during a sale. So, during a recent spring sale, some pieces were almost 50% off.  After reading reviews about rings & necklaces tarnishing, I thought well I'll try some earrings as it seemed no one was complaining of those tarnishing. So I ordered 3 pairs of earrings, spent about $115 (this is with the sale prices marked down 30-50%).  When my pieces arrived I could NOT believe the quality. It looked and felt SO cheap. Not even worth the sale prices I paid.  Like another reviewer on here said, I have jewelry from forever 21 and target that FEELS more durable, sturdy and luxurious than this cheap crap. Sorry but that's exactly what it is. CRAP. For these prices? Is this a joke? And from such a wealthy and well known celebrity such as Kristin Cavallari? She says on the show it's her life dream? Is it really? If it is, then invest a little more of your own $ into making it a high quality jewelry line because I'd sure love to know what it's costing them to make such cheap jewelry. At those retail prices, they're making a KILLING in profit. I can make this jewelry myself for a few bucks. Seriously. So, I sent customer service a very honest email stating I would be returning the pieces and that I was so disappointed & shocked with the jewelry and that they should cover the cost of shipping since this wasn't my fault or in my plans to even send back. I expected quality jewelry at even the sale prices I paid and I certainly didn't get that.  They apologized, offered to send me replacements. They emailed me a shipping label. I sent the pieces back. I stated I did NOT want replacements due to the cheap quality. A few days later I get an email with a refund but they charged me for shipping. Not okay. So I called the actual store and ended up actually speaking to Kolby (the one who appears on the show).  She was very nice, good customer service. At first gave me reasons as to why they charged me for shipping and that they could not refund me for the shipping. I told her in that case, I can't wait to write my review and I should have trusted all the other reviews from unhappy customers.  She placed me on hold, comes back and says \"for the sake of your review, I'll refund you for the shipping.\"  I said thank you.  She then asked me to tell her in detail what I was unhappy with about the jewelry. So I was VERY honest.  I compared the line to Kendra Scott, which is a high $ luxury line but you get quality, luxury jewelry that will last you forever. It does not tarnish, nor do they have to put a card in the packaging telling you not to wear lotion, perfume or anything, oh and that the pH of your skin can tarnish the jewelry. Why doesn't KS have to do this? Because Kendra Scott is clearly investing in her company and wants to ensure quality products for the customers' money! Everything you are reading here, I said to Kolby.  And I truly give her credit for listening to me and taking it all in in the way that she did.  Like I said, I'm very honest and blunt and I'm sure it was not easy for her to accept my criticism but she did and did it well.  She expressed to me that the company WILL be working with a new manufacturer in the future to fix the issue of the jewelry feeling so cheap.  I told her that's great news but I truly don't think I would believe it until Kristin Cavallari herself come out and address these issues publicly.  Customers deserve to hear the truth.  UJ needs to take ownership and publicly address the issues that we are all experiencing. They need to PUBLICLY tell their customers that they are aware of the issues and that they will be using a new manufacturer to come out with better material, and better quality pieces.

It was a wonderful way to wrap up a great day. We were warmly greeted at the door by the hostess. It was noticeable right away that the staff was following COVID precautions, guests were appropriately spaced, and everyone I saw entering, walking about, and exiting the restaurant were wearing masks. Jake was our waiter and he did a fantastic job explaining the restaurant concept, the menu, and made good suggestions. It's clear he's a star employee and represents the restaurant well. Now for the food.... I started with a watermelon cocktail that had freshly juiced melon in it that was refreshingly delicious. We opted for small plates and dessert instead of an entree. We shared the drunken eggs, ZLT-zucchini topped with brisket , cheese, panko crumbs and a delicious tomato reduction, crispy chicken biscuit sandwiches, and pork belly with melon. Everything was delicious, but the stand out was the ZLT. Dessert was an espresso chocolate torte that was rich yet light and a coconut key lime pie that tasted of fresh key limes. We were happily stuffed when we left and will definitely return and highly recommend.","date":"2020-08-10 12:30:28"}

I've seen some other Cirque shows (The Beatles Love and another one in Vegas) and the Beatles one is still my all time favorite. I've seen that one twice it's so good!  In saying that, this one was different but still enjoyable. I don't want to spoil anything for anyone that might be going to see it so I'll try and be vague in my descriptions. There are acts like juggling, jump roping, extreme bike riding, aerial stuff, and more (I don't want to give it away). All the performers are very talented. My absolute favorite portion was the part with trampoline artists. It was crazy to see how coordinated they are together. \n\nThe venue is so cool, you feel like you are actually in a building and not in just a glorified tent. It's air conditioned and actually cold in there! Drinks will put you back a pretty penny...those of the alcoholic kind. I got a sangria and that was $15.  A can of bud light is the same price. I'm not sure how much the other concessions were as I did not partake. \n\nThe show started promptly at 8 and ran almost until 10pm with like a 20-25 minute intermission. Another favorite part of mine was that there was a dude that looked like Pauly D from the Jersey Shore in it. I didn't care for his strange comedic act...but I just was obsessed with the fact he was a spitting image of Pauly D. \n\nThe music was wonderful as well. It was performed by a live band which is always great. \n\nIf you are considering going and have some extra cash to burn it's definitely an entertaining show. Do I think it's the best Cirque show I've ever seen? No. But this isn't Vegas people so calm down.\n\nThanks to the Philly Yelp team for the tickets and giving me and my sister a \"Mom's Night Out\"!!!!","date":"2018-07-23 18:12:19"}

Is pretty darn awesome, yet eerie and just all around odd BUT I love it. I have been blessed with a father in law who loves German food so we go here nearly every time they're in town. First of all it is in a bit of a run down area and seems a bit sketchy but once you get inside you realize how truly unique this place is. The decor is definitely a German blast from the past but I don`t mind that. I`m a huge fan of different and out of the norm so this worked for me. The service is always SLOW. That I will say about this place. I`m not coming here for a quick lunch, though, so that never really bothered me too much. It is definitely a sit down, take your time, enjoy your company, and chew your food slowly sort of place. Seriously. Chew slowly because it could be a while before you can flag down a waitress for the check to exit. That aside the food here is delicious. I don`t have much experience with German food but I think I could successfully visit Germany and not starve based on this restaurant's selections. I`ve sampled the sausage and herring appetizer plates along with my table and I`m a fan of both. The herring tastes like tuna in a tangy cream sauce. The sausage plate is just yummy! I mean, who doesn't like a good German sausage? That person is not me. Moving on. I`ve had two different dishes here before. One was a vegetarian dish that included cabbage, spaetzle, and some other non animal products. That was my first visit and I don`t really recall anything special about it. The flavors were good but I never ordered it again. What I do order each time now is the sauerbraten plate with potato pancakes. Good god! Talk about a heart attack on a plate with those potato pancakes but who cares about the health aspect. The sauerbraten is AMAZING! So tender, so flavorful, and the sauce it comes with is perfect. The potato pancakes are so greasy and sinful. Addicting is another word. Makes me want to eat a plate of them and then workout. They serve some bread rolls at the beginning of the meal that are usually crusty and not worth eating but if you're really hungry and are waiting(a very long time) for your meal you might want to just risk chipping a tooth. Slap some butter on that roll, and chow down. They have a small wine selection. I usually get some Riesling or Piesporter. No complaints there. Have a few glasses and the whole slow service issue wont even matter. Trust me. Check this place out if only to say that you've gone, tried the food, and escaped at some point.","date":"2012-04-07 14:24:19"}

We asked him to take the lead as far as ordering so we could get an across the board (ish) take of the cuisine. This is what he ordered for the table of 4 and a toddler. I didn't get any pictures because too busy devouring food.\n\na) Bijon guisado - this is the thinner rice noodle pancit. This is the style I am used to and it was perfect in every way! Loaded with tasty noodles and veggies like cabbage, snow peas and carrots along with pork (again last time I did the chicken one with the spaghetti style noodles). 100% getting this again.\n\nb) Bistek tagalog - I think this might have been my favorite thing of the day. And it is so simple, beef and onions in a sauce.  The citrus marinade makes the meat tender AF! My husband couldn't get enough of this dish. The accompanying sauce with it is packed with notes of sour and sweet, but still savory. Perfect over rice. \n\nc) Sinigang na baboy - or pork hot and sour soup basically.  It is closer to a Thai style than Chinese, but definitely and obviously its own thing. Very light colored broth filled with big hunks of pork (with bone), okra, green beans, eggplant (I think). Honestly, my first time having okra and I am a convert, in this instance, no slime (I've heard it can be slimy), the outside retains some texture like a green bean and then the seed pods are almost like mini peas. Overall, a very light, and bright soup.  \n\nd) Fried pompano - ordered this once again, still a mild fish with zero greasiness. It is good on its own, but is kicked up just a notch with that touch of soy sauce. \n\nMy main take away was that the food is jam packed with flavor, but not heavy or overwhelmingly greasy. Every new bite was fun and a surprise and I am really glad to broaden my palate a bit with this. As I stated in my last review, my go to \"cuisine\" is asian flavors, and this is a new favorite. \n\nSo run, don't walk and support this hole in the wall establishment. It doesn't come across as very busy, and the prices are incredible (too low honestly). I hope it is a lasting institution for the area. If you're in need of something new, and a food that isn't oversaturated in Reno or overly represented, I suggest spending a lunch coming here and exploring the offerings. \n\nOverall, I am sold on this style of cuisine. Every single thing was unique in flavor while still understanding the common thread of what makes it fillipino food.  Obviously I am no expert but just fell in love with the food today. I was surprised at how much food there was too. We had 4 adults and a toddler and thought 4 dishes were barely going to cover it but we had a ton of leftovers. \n\nAs far as atmosphere, yes the booths are a bit run down aka second hand, but the rest is very clean. The only semi negative thing was once we got our food, we had to flag down the server for boxes and a check.  And there were a couple flies that were relentless and annoying. Additionally, they have multiple hanging and standing UV air sanitizers placed throughout the restaurant. They take all covid precautions seriously.","date":"2021-09-20 18:00:49"}

We had Tony the sales rep come over and he agreed it was their fault and they would take care of the cost of repair. I contacted Tony many times with no reply to furnish the repair invoice.

Many picture opportunities.  I am glad we went on a week night because it was cheaper and less crowded than a weekend. \n\nOnce we boarded, we were seated in our the first class area that we chose.  These tickets were $59 per seat and had to be bought in groups of 4.  My group got to face one another with a small table and we each got hot chocolate and a cookie.  The kids were excited about this.  The cookie was not very good and hot chocolate was cold. \n\nThe ride took about 30-40 minutes.  During the ride the crew danced and sang which was fun and festive.  They tried reading part of the Polar express book but no one in my group could hear it.  The train goes through downtown and through the landing.  My 7 yo step son was more interested in the homeless people on the riverfront than the train ride.  \n\nTowards the end of ride Santa gets on the train and hands out bells.  One of the crew punched the kids golden tickets which they enjoyed.  The kids had a decent time but I don't think we would do it again.  Probably not worth $239 for 4 tickets and then the $5 parking. \n\nThe kids had more fun afterwards doing the merry go round which was an additional $10 for two kids and playing on the playground.","date":"2021-12-14 21:39:44"}

First off, ever since they got rid of the self-checkout machines, it seems like the lines are longer & there's more of a wait time to check out. They also decided in removing the self-checkout, they'd add a couple more cashier lanes, plus they switched the customer service area to the other side of the store. Now, it's in the way. If you're checking out at customer service, or if you're not using one of the cashier lanes, there's barely any room in between the first lane & the wall of the customer service area. And with people waiting & carts & whatnot, it's just barely any room to get by when you're trying to leave. And having the customer service area on the other side of the store just gets in the way as well. It used to be out of the way of everything, but now where they have it, when people are waiting in line for it it blocks off the front of the store.

At one point, they had their music (specifically the base) so loud that my desktop monitor that was mounted on the wall fell off because my whole apartment was vibrating. This is particularly annoying because I lived in the \"quiet building\" that does claimed to have a zero tolerance policy for noise. \nThe management is absolutely awful. They have never done anything to help with the noise or any other issue that has come up. \nThe latest in the long list of sub-par management has been their handling of an apartment fire that resulted in a flood (from the sprinklers) in half a dozen different apartments (including mine). The water came through the walls and flooded my bedroom, soaking my shoes and clothes. The management staff, instead of immediately getting in touch with me, decided to send in a restoration team that put all of my wet clothes into piles to set there and develop mildew. These crews gave me absolutely no time to grab my stuff or move it myself, and instead, a bunch of strange men touched every single one of my belongings and moved them for me. \nThe cadence did not offer to move me to a hotel or anywhere else, nor provide me with a project time frame of how long the repairs would take. The only answer I got were from the contractors that came in to rip up carpet, base boards, dry wall, and insulation. When I asked them what was happening, they responded with \"there's black mold in the walls that is not from the flood.\" meaning the poor construction of the building left me exposed to black mold for god only knows how long. \nMy issue with this stems from the fact that not only is this bad for my health, but I was informed of it through a THIRD PARTY rather than from the MANAGEMENT STAFF who are supposed to be responsible for handling all of these issues. \nI called them, my insurance agent called them, my lawyer called them, even my mother called them, and they have not returned a single phone call or email. \nToday, I handed them a 5 days notice that I would be terminating my lease due to health related hazards and I will be moving out within the next three days. I have never been more relieved in my life. \n\nTL;DR the management sucks, the building is not safe, I HIGHLY recommend you do not live here.

If he was busy he could have answered and possibly said, \"please hold\", anything instead of hanging up on a paying customer. I should have gone elsewhere after the first disconnect. I truly wish that I had. There are too many good restaurants in King of Prussia with better food, better prices, good portions and great customer service. I will not be going back. They were recently advertised on TV and given a good review. Maybe that was for TV because look at the food. Does it look appealing to you? Look at the undercooked greens, the very small portion of ribs, etc. No way is that a half pound, on the worst scale. Unbelievable!!! Save your money and your time. It's not worth it. I wasted my hard earned money. Don't waste yours. Prior to going here I told so many people to try this place. I'm sorry if I don't catch you in time to tell you of my experience. Look, you can get better barbecue at Dwights and Deke's. Tender, juicy, great portions, flavorful, great customer service, and cost effective. Save your money and time don't go and be as disappointed as me and my family.  They don't deserve any stars. Everything that looks good to you is not good for you. Don't let the outside building structure and the hoopla fool you. My food was not good. Jason tried to push me to order online. Why??? When we arrived at the restaurant it was empty so why wasn't I given royal treatment? He continually hung up the phone then tried to press me to order online. What are they paying you for Jason? To stand there hang up on people, try to push them to order online, etc. No Jason what you are doing is causing this business to lose money. I didn't like the barbecue sauce either.... They should close this place down. It's a joke, just like Jason. Don't order Takeout or Delivery, you've been warned!!!   I now have indigestion. Let me find some Tums.  Did you see the size of the side orders? One Ounce cups at best for $12.00. This place is a rip off. Buyer Beware!!! This is not even a one star restaurant. Don't let the location fool you. I wish I had read the reviews prior to giving this place a try. I would have NEVER EVER had given them a try. The good reviews were given by either an employee or during the first week of opening where they probably put on their best efforts. As a business owner Morgan's let me give you a bit of advise, you are supposed to pot on your best efforts each and every day!","date":"2021-07-04 03:13:33"}

When my nails were finally done I reached in my wallet and pulled out my card. The owner began to stutter and finally got out \"Uh....uh...can you go to our ATM in the back\"? I said \"Excuse Me...I've seen you accept charges all afternoon \"! He said \"Oh well..it's only 58 cents\"..I said \"that's not the issue .. I sat here and watched you accept everyone else's card...why then can you no longer take cards\"? He muttered something and said \"It's back here\" as he motioned. To avoid making an even larger scene I went to the back and withdrew money to pay for my services. When I returned to the front of the store I said to him, as his wife was at that moment processing a customer's charge, \"I must tell you how disappointed I am that this occurred and I'm sure if the tables were turned you would be offended if you were in my place of business and you were treated unfairly for no other reason than your skin color.

Same reviews for months and no change, somewhat sad.\n\nI've taken my vehicle to this location several times with each time being a terrible experience. I needed an alignment and was replacing suspension parts. It took them three tries to get it right. Each time I had to take it back included several days for them to work on it as well as the costs for me to Uber back and forth 2 additional times.\n\nI took it back later for another alignment months later, and I also needed the travel mode turned off as my car automatically puts itself in that mode when it's not driven. I do this every spring as I don't drive the two seater in the winter months. It took them an additional day over what I was told to do the alignment, and when I went to pick it up, they didn't even try to turn off the travel mode (you need a car computer). I asked the mechanic if he could do it really fast, since I waited and paid for this service, and he told me he didn't know how and sent me on my way. When I tried to complain to corporate, they did nothing. No refund for the service I didn't even receive. \n\nThis last time I called at 8am yesterday and asked if I could bring my car in for a routine state inspection. I said if it's going to take a few days, I can't go with pep boys I need to take it somewhere else. I was told my car would be serviced today, if not first thing tomorrow morning. So I bring it in by 9am. By noon the next day I call the shop to see how things are going, and the person on the phone tells me they haven't even begun to work on the car yet. I said I asked you guys in advance that if it was going to take more time, I would just simply go elsewhere. I was in a time crunch. The person puts me on hold, and then comes back and says you can come get your keys and take the car, essentially wasting 2 days of my time, and now I have to rent a car last minute because they still are not done with my car at 4pm. It's a damn inspection! It's one of the simplest procedure a mechanic has to do!\n\nI will be taking my business to a small business\/mechanic who actually works on cars and doesn't treat customers like garbage.

I've been here twice so far, and plan on coming back many more times in the future. To start off, this place is definitely not your standard \"American food\" joint; I guess it's supposed to be classified as \"New American\" although that's pretty vague. And I will also note that I took my relatives visiting from Taiwan here and they weren't huge fans, I guess in part because they weren't used to these types of flavors. But if you're looking for American food with a little twist, this is definitely the place for ya!\n\nOf the drinks menu, I've gotten the Antisocial Extrovert which was a little too sour for my liking, but was still good. There's a lot of good cocktail options and most come in super cute little cups.\n\nAnd of the dinner menu, I've just stuck with the small plates (the large plates are a little bit out of the poor post-grad's budget). Some of the small plates are large enough to fill you up, but some are definitely just appetizer small plates so I'd ask if you're trying to just order a small plate as an entree. I've tried the pork & pear flatbread, the mac and cheese, pork belly confit, rosemary truffle fries, and the bread pudding. The pork & pear flatbread is amazing and filling (have ordered twice), but that combination of savory meat, pesto, and fruit might not appeal to everyone. The mac and cheese is really good as well, and the bread crumbs on top add a nice little crunch (make sure you get the loaded mac and cheese, because on it's own I think it gets a little boring). The pork belly is good, fatty in the right spots, but this is one example of a plate that definitely won't fill you up. The fries are great and come with two dipping sauces and seasoned with, you guessed it, rosemary. Lastly, I have dreams about that bread pudding sometimes. It's just great. Try it out.","date":"2017-09-14 03:14:06"}

How cool is that?! We sat inside but I could see a really nice patio that was full of patrons enjoying their meals. We were served chips and salsa upon being seated and we both opted for one of their signature margaritas. I went for the Mango Chili margarita and Hubby had the Blood Orange. Both were good but I preferred Hubby's just a bit more. Hubby stayed true to his craving and went with the Huevos Rancheros and said they were very good. I on the other hand decided to give the lunch side of the menu some attention and went for the Best of New Mexico Combination plate so I could taste a little of everything. The Green Chili Chicken Enchilada rocked it as did the Chili Relleno. Both were delicious! Even though we were both stuffed and had a couple of to go containers to take with us that we weren't able to finish I still wanted my Fried Ice Cream. Come on! You can't have Mexican food without Fried Ice Cream! Well that's my motto anyways! Theirs was the basic cornflake kind which happens to be my favorite and I always keep it simple with honey only.

I realized that I had get back in the order line and ask about our order.  They then went into the kitchen area and had to find our order.  I think that they need to use a PA system over their speakers to announce that your order is ready to pick up, it would help with the confusion and congestion in the ordering line, especially since the dining room is closed and people are waiting on the patio like we were.\n\nAs for the food, the tacos are legit!

I don't mind waiting, especially when I'm getting the best of the best. But what I got was so far south of what I imagined. First off, there was very little jalapeño sauce and mayo, and what there was under the pile of tomatoes, not generously over the top as advertised. My bun was also very soggy, I ended up tearing away a good portion of it. The hot dog was okay. Not bad, but nothing outstanding either. This was my very first Sonoran dog, and unfortunately I was very disappointed in this southern Arizona staple. \n\nI also ordered a serving of arroz con lèche which to my dismay was just a cup of pre-packaged store-bought crap. No where was it advertised that this is the case so I expected housemade rice pudding.\n\nEl Guero Canelo almost claims to have the best carne asada, so I'm going to give the one more try next time I'm in Tucson. I hope to update my review with three more well-deserved stars.","date":"2021-11-15 22:40:03"}

Where do I begin?\nLets start at the top.\n\nI booked my appointment online & they let you choose different time slots & each time is allocated to one of their fitting rooms & how many people I can bring.\n\n1:00 Suite 2 (+3 people)\n1:00 Suite 4 (+2 people)\n2:00 Suit 1 (+2 people)\n\nIt looked something like that. You choose your time & you choose your suite based on availability and maybe how many people you are bringing. So basically from the beginning the feeling is (you better not be bringing too many of your friends). Which I was only bring my MOH so whatever. I chose my time at 7PM on Wednesday night. \n\nThen the confirmation of my appointment arrived via email and reminds me that I ONLY GET ONE HOUR in the shop and it urged me \"to arrive early or on time so that you get the most out of your 1 hour.\" This is the shortest bridal appointment I have had so far, most places say appointments are 75 minutes or 90 minutes but they also prefaced it with  (if you go longer thats no problem!) Lovely's vibe was \"you get one hour & one hour only because then we will kick you out\",\n\nSo I arrived early, 10 minutes early. I buzzed the buzzer with my MOH & we were greeted by a frantic stylist who ushered us in & told us to wait & that she would be right with us.\n\nSo far no problem, we were early, so we would sit on couch. Cool. At 7PM she came back and apologized that they werent running on time and that we need to wait on the couch still.\nNow I know they have several \"suites\" as I booked online and I could have chosen one of several 7PM appointments for other rooms. So i assumed my suite wasnt the one running on time. But when the other bride finally left at 7:20 (when we were allowed to start our appointment) I saw that another stylist had been helping them, so why couldnt my stylist help me at the same time and put me in a different suite? There were at least two stylists there and I think 3 or more different suites and only one other bride. I did the math.\n\nNow lets back track for a moment to where we were still waiting in the front room. I got a little antsy at about 7:10 & walked back into the salon to just start peeking through the racks. As my MOH & I approached the first rack the girl (her name is Aleza) stepped out of the office & asked to please wait in the front room. I asked her if I could start looking at the dresses & she didnt say \"no\", she said \"I will go through the dresses with you when the appointment starts\". So I asked, \"can I look at them now anyways to just start to get ideas?\" (BTW there was no one in the show room but us the other bride was back in the dressing room) & she said no because she wanted the other bride to have space & not feel crowded by my MOH & I. \n\nSo back we sit for another 10 minutes. Then at 7:20 my appointment starts.\nAleza asks me the feel of my wedding & my budget, which I tell her is $1500-$3000.\nShe takes me to the racks & starts to point out some dresses. She is pointing out things that are not what I described to her that I liked but she goes rack by rack with me & I try to start to look at things on my own and she is very disapproving & tells me that she wants to take me through every rack first, once we get through all the racks I now have \"permission\" to look through the dresses. My MOH & I start looking & when my MOH found something she thought I would like she tried to take it off the rack (keeping it on the hanger mind you) & show it to me, the stylist scolded her & told her not to take anything off the rack. \n\nAs I started to find dresses I wanted to try on, she also told me not to take them off the rack myself, but she also wasn't taking them off either to go & hang them in dressing room, after selecting around 4 dresses & her not moving from her spot I said, \"are you going to pull these for me?\" she said, \"I will pull them once you are finished selecting them\"  I replied, \"wow you can remember them all exactly?\" & she said snootily, \"yes, I have been working here a long time, I know the dresses really well.\"\n\nAs I go around the room I make it to the last rack of dresses & point one out that I want to try on & she says \"that one is out of your price range\", she reminded me throughout the process which were out of my price range. The dresses have price tags on them, I see the price. If I ask to try it on, let me try it on.\n\nANYWAYS, we get to the fitting room, I am NOT a modest person, I dont mind if another girl sees me naked. But I had been to 4 other appointments before arriving at Lovely & all the stylists gave me the option of modesty, letting me step into the dresses myself & then they would come in & zip me up etc. She stood in the room the whole time & didnt let me touch any part of the dress. I have never felt more judged or vulnerable while being naked in front of a person.\n\nThis was a full on bad experience from beginning to end. I left other apts hugging my stylist, I left there in a bad mood.\n\nGo to Philly Bride or Ashe B. & Co. They have wine too!","date":"2016-12-05 01:13:19"}

Yay!\n\nMotions is a store in a nondescript small building situated across US-1 from the Pilgrim Gardens shopping center.  Their building is wedged between a car dealership and a donut shop.

The store is bright and clean with good flooring to test dance shoes with.  I was greeted warmly and shown where their ballroom shoes are.  I was advised they have stopped stocking ballroom shoes so what they had was out & discounted.  \n\nI was then left to browse.  I tested a few pairs that didn't quite work for me.  The salesperson came back to check.  I asked about character shoes.  Yes, they kept these in stock. They are only eliminating ballroom shoes - character, tap, ballet & Jazz\/hip hop we're staying. We discussed my concerns.  She brought out a pair that fit well and felt great.  Boom! \n\nI wandered over to the costumes & dance gear, idly looking through the adult items.  What's this?  A great dress for a Renaissance Faire in my size?  On sale?  I was shown the dressing rooms, where I tried the dress on as decided it was great.  Double boom!  \n\nMy salesperson cheerfully processed my transaction, and I went home happy. \n\nIt's a pretty great store with a nice selection and friendly people who know dance.

And the fear of disappointment of buying a stale, tasteless cake was real. \n\nWhen hubs found out his nephew and his new wife didn't plan on having a wedding cake (¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯) after dinner, I came across a few that were closed for the Holiday season- but we certainly lucked out on this one on Cypress St in West Tampa. Hubs stepped it up and got them one they would appreciate to celebrate their special day. \n\nAside from the long-standing history here, hubs ordered and paid by phone from NY with ease. And when we came here to pick up the cake, the smell of sweets was all around even with my mask on. Glass shelving with fig bread, cookies and unusual pastry+fruit combinations I've haven't seen at any NYC Italian bakery I've been to. \n\nThe price is right, service is plentiful from any counter you go up to and the Strawberry Shortcake hubs got for his nephew was very good. The cream seemed like a lot on top- but it was actually good, the cake itself was spongey-soft and strawberries tasted like strawberries. \n \nI may not be Italian, but I feel like a neighborhood isn't complete without a family-run spot for fresh-baked bread, cannolis, cakes, zeppoles, paninis, Pignoli cookies and the obligatory rainbow cookies. This one is it.","date":"2021-12-26 12:32:24"}

It tasted like my mom's homemade banana bread - super moist, tons of banana flavor, and plenty of nuts. I also use to enjoy the Carrot Cake muffin. It also tasted homemade. \nI've had both kinds of muffin recently and they were awful. So bad that my husband forgot I didn't like them anymore and he brought me one on Saturday and I refused to eat it. I just couldn't force myself to do it. \nBoth flavor of muffin tasted weirdly the same. They tasted like the same batter\/mix was used for both and they actually tasted like it could possibly be the same base they would use for a corn muffin. Both the carrot and banana muffins were dry and tasted almost exactly the same. Both had nuts and the carrot cake one had a weird glaze topping instead of the usual delightful cream cheese frosting. I don't know if the muffin mix comes from corporate like this awful concoction or if it's the franchisee cutting corners to save money, but either way both muffins are a horrible representation of this company. \n\nAnd one other note - the customer service has also gone downhill. I get that on the weekends, it's probably high school kids working that don't want to be there but a company needs to know who they put into positions as their representation of their company. The staff always acts completely put out by customers ordering food. They take no pride in their work. Again, this is just to let the owner know how their employees reflect on their business.

But watching them flip the pizza dough in the open kitchen is one of those feats that truly need to be witnessed if your sitting bar side.\n\nBeer wise Birra definitely impresses with a tap list that rotates daily, and an amicable selections of cans and bottles.

Go Vertical has some advantages and disadvantages compared to the others, but overall I wasn't thoroughly impressed.  Maybe I expected too much from \"Philadelphia's only rock climbing gym, and the largest of its kind on the east coast\".  While it's the only gym in the city, there are plenty of other options in the burbs.  If I lived or worked in the city, I'm sure I'd join GV.  But I work out in KoP, so Oaks it is.\n\nIn regards to the \"largest of its kind\" claim, that is probably GV's best asset.  There are over 200 routes, and plenty of top-roping and lead options.  The lead arch that spans over the gym is impressive, though I didn't do any leading during my visit.  Plenty of top rope routes to choose from, and the 50 ft high section of wall was unique.  The overhanging bouldering section was small (lots of problems, but close together so only about 3 people could be on the wall at the same time.. I imagine this gets crowded).  However, they also have bouldering all over the gym, just watch out for other climbers.\n\nI wasn't impressed with the route setting though.  Routes seemed unnecessarily difficult and lacked footholds. On easier routes I found myself simply muscling moves b\/c there weren't footholds or I couldn't see a clean way to do a move.  On more difficult routes for me I'd fall sometimes, not b\/c the move was too difficult, but b\/c the move was awkward or didn't have sufficient footholds.\n\nNot crowded for a saturday afternoon.  There were plenty of people there (~30?) but the gym is spacious and we didn't have a problem finding a variety of open stuff to climb.\n\nIn regards to other yelpers comments: The staff were friendly (only interacted with a girl and guy at the desk), and the ropes and holds did seem on the older\/dirty side.\n\nParking note: Apparently they used to own the lot next door, hence the \"plenty of free well-lit parking\" claim on their site.  But Sugarhouse casino took over all the lots, and you can't park there without going to the casino (think they patrol the lots and tow).  There's free street parking around the gym, but I can see it being difficult to park during more crowded times.","date":"2011-01-27 16:49:38"}

Seems like they have their ways and are successful since they've been around for 40 years. In future visits I would be more specific about how I want my food prepared. I would also come here only under very casual circumstances...lunch, happy hour, Sunday afternoon food\/beer date with friends, or if I just wanted specific seafood and was in the area. I would not celebrate any special occasions here as the atmosphere is plain. Read on for deets.\n\nAtmosphere:\n- Small restaurant. Pretty quiet. About 6-8 tables of varying size total. Orange\/warm colored walls. Little to no decor.\n- Very simple, ultra casual style. Good place to go if you want seafood, but don't feel like dealing with high-end prices or pretension.\n- They played really romantic-ish music while we were there which was strange for the restaurant since it's very casual and it was NYE. Gave me the impression they tried to make up for the plain walls with the music.\n- Quiet atmosphere. I could comfortably talk to my dinner date without yelling. \n- Because of the size of the restaurant, the 2-seater table we sat at was really awkwardly placed.\n- Clean bathroom.\n\nFood:\n- I ordered 6 raw oysters as an appetizer ($9), and lobster and beef tenderloins for entree ($30). \n- The oysters were very good. In my mind, it's hard to screw up something raw! They came chilled over ice with lemon and a marinara sauce (standard). Shells about 3-3.5\" size - good size.\n- The entree came with asparagus and mashed potatoes. Lobster was a good size, but not tender enough. Beef was over cooked. Side vegetables were very good. Asparagus cooked right and bright green, and mashed potatoes, standard comfort food fare.\n\nService:\n- The owner\/head waitress\/hostess (small place, so not sure) was very friendly. We had trouble spotting the restaurant from the street (it's very small and tucked in between a couple businesses) and called the restaurant for help. The owner saw us at the corner and navigated us to the restaurant over the phone.\n- Our waiter was very nice, but seemed overwhelmed or distracted. Missed standard cues such as: introducing himself, clearing empty plates or glasses from table, didn't leave us with salt and pepper on the table (had to flag him down), served lobster without drawn butter (had to flag him down). \n- Spilled my martini on the table.\n- Waiter also spilled water in front of our table and splashed us. Not too big of a deal, it was just water, but he already striked out a couple times.\n- I mentioned that the beef was dry and all he did was quickly mumble, \"Sorry.\"\n\nDrinks:\n- Ordered their specialty winter drink, an apple cinnamon martini ($8\/9) and then a mango martini ($8\/9). \n- Apple cinn drink was unique, but I wouldn't order it again.\n- Mango martini tasted like it was made from actual juice. Flavor actually reminded me that of those huge cans of apricot juice. Would not order again.","date":"2012-01-01 20:17:36"}

The wings arrived warm, with a crunchy exterior but moist interior. The Asian garlic sauce,  Salt & Vinegar dry rub, and the Kickin Bourbon sauce were great.  However, the disappointing sauce was the Habanero Mango since it lacked flavor compared to BWW's version. For fun, we got the kids mac n cheese which is just Kraft and some tater tots. Both met expectations.  The funnelcake fries desert was ok.","date":"2021-11-21 00:16:31"}

I haven't been to a cheesecake restaurant in a loooong time.  I naively thought this restaurant was part of the big American chain \"Cheesecake Factory\" but I was so wrong. At the beginning of the event we met the owner and she described its history as a locally owned Edmonton family business.  It started over 25 years ago in their Calgary location and has been going ever since and expanded to Edmonton, Medicine Hat and Spruce Grove locations.\n\nThey focus on using quality local ingredients and they care about what they are serving. I was very impressed to hear their history because I just didn't realize they were a local Made in Alberta success.\n\nAs part of our event we had the opportunity to decorate our own pre-made cheesecakes! If you want to book a great party this is a great idea.  We probably had close to 30+ people at our event and it went very smoothly.  They provide an already baked cheesecake and all of the fixin's to decorate it up. We had a blast at our event.\n\nThe cheesecake I ended up with (the marble variety) was exceptionally good!  My decorating may not have been near as nice as anything they put out though but it was a great time.\n\nIf you are looking for a great place for dessert I highly recommend them! I am looking forward to going back and trying some of their non-dessert options and reporting back.","date":"2015-11-27 01:49:31"}

It was I am certain magnificent for what it was, plenty of meat, creamy sauce served on a bed of greens.  It's just that the greens themselves had a bitter finish, something the haute cuisine set enjoy but I do not.   \n\nNow here's the amazing part.  Our server, Jose, noticed that I was picking around and at the salad.  I did NOT fuss (FDC can back me on this).  I didn't even mention to FDC that I did not enjoy the bitter greens.

He came, asked me if I was enjoying the meal, I said it was fine,  he probed, I confessed, he immediately offered me something else, took it off the bill, and refused to take 'no' for an answer when I insisted it was my palate, not the salad itself, that was the problem.  \n\nFor the service alone in this case I'd give it 5 stars.

They all just seem so unhappy in their job, and in the way they treat customers, which leads me to believe the owner must be a terrible boss who does not appreciate them, or maybe underpays them, who knows! After experiencing such bad customer service over and over, I have no desire or intention to come back to this sushi place. I've had enough, and there are plenty of other sushi places where people welcome you and your patronage, and where the sushi is way better than here.","date":"2019-02-28 02:10:45"}

This old-fashioned ice cream parlor offers traditional flavors along with some pretty exotic fruit flavors (banana, coconut, blueberry, black raspberry, teaberry, etc.) They scoop VERY LARGE, but I still decided on a 3-scoop large since I wanted to sample three different flavors! (You can mix two with a medium and only one with the small). Chocolate was rich and decadent, and peach was very flavorful, but the star of my order was the blueberry nestled in the middle. There were bits of blueberry throughout and the flavors were spot on authentic, without excessive amounts of sugar to mask the flavor! I also sampled the chocolate chip, and it was by far the best I'd have ever had. In addition to the chunks, they also added in shavings of chocolate to really add color and texture to the silky smooth vanilla base. \n\nWhen ordering, I'd suggest you pick the \"to-go\" containers (they look like the paper Chinese food ones) over their cones, since their friendly servers will cram more ice cream inside...I saw some people with the cones and can say that three baseball-sized scoops on top of your dainty cone will be one hell of a balancing act! \n\nIf you're near Olde City \/ Penn's Landing in Philly, this place is definitely worth your visit, and should be as much of a staple as the obligatory Philly cheese steak!","date":"2010-08-29 13:46:44"}

It's great to see so many countries represented in the community wanting to share more of what they have to offer.

However, once I get off the Groat Bridge I'm never sure where to go. As they encourage so many people to cycle to the event, they need a designated bike lane into the park. If you walk your bike in with the pedestrians then you overshoot the bike parking area because the walkway is fenced off and then you have to back track. If you ride on the road, the lanes are separated by cones so they are very narrow and you have to go in the bus lane. It just seems like there should be some proper signage for the cyclists.\n\nSecondly, I just went yesterday to the 2013 version of Heritage Festival and had 3 food tickets left. I went for the deep fried wontons from the Hong Kong tent. Worst decision ever. It was more like deep fried wonton wrappers. Instead of it being wrapped like a wonton, the wrapper was folded diagonally in half into a triangle and had a tiny piece of meat the size of a dime.

The customer service from this company has been terrible. I should not have to be chasing a company down to get a response. I will find another company who respects me, my time and my money. The past month has made it clear that UWD does not care about their customers or their satisfaction.\n-I had an installation appointment scheduled for Saturday, 6\/1 between 8-10AM. I received multiple emails the week before confirming my appointment & received one the Friday before reminding me of my appointment the next day. On Saturday, 6\/1, I waited for the installation crew, they never called and never showed up. I called the office around 10:45 to find out when they would be arriving since they had missed their appointment. I was told the operator would try to contact the installation crew & find out. Over an hour later I had still heard nothing back from UWD, so I called the operator again. I was informed that she could not get a hold of the crew. I said I would assume no one was going to show up for the day. \n-On Monday, 6\/3, I received a call from Stephanie asking how my installation went. I told her that they no-called no-showed. I was told by Stephanie that she would look into it and give me a call back. I never heard from Stephanie again. \n-On Wednesday, 6\/5, I received an email asking me to take a customer satisfaction survey \"now that my installation is complete.\" At that time, I had told 2 different people that my installation was not complete, yet no one updated my customer file to reflect that. That just solidified how unorganized this company is.  After taking the customer satisfaction survey, I posted a review on Facebook about my experience so far & said I would not recommend UWD. On 6\/5, UWD replied to my FB review with the following comment, \"Amy, we are so sorry to hear this. It is always our number one priority-to make sure the customer is completely satisfied. We have heard your voice and want to take care of you. We have let a member of our management team know. Thank you, UWD Customer Service\" I never received a call from their management team to \"take care of me\" as they stated in their response. \n-On 6\/5, after my FB review, Bryan, the person I had scheduled my installation appointment with called me and said today was the first he was hearing that my installation had not occurred because he had been out of town. He said he called the installation crew to ask why my windows had not been installed. Their response was that they had my windows loaded onto the truck but were having truck problems. They did not call me because they did not have my paperwork with my phone number. If they did not have my paperwork with my phone number, how were they even going to find my address? Usually all of that information is on the same paperwork. Also, if they really did not have my phone number, it would've been just as easy for them to call UWD's main office & ask them to call me and tell me they were not showing up. I understand that things happen & appointments need to be changed, what I don't understand is why no one could have the courtesy to let me know that my original appointment was going to be missed. Bryan then told me that he would get back to me on the same day to let me know when he could get me on the calendar for an installation. I never heard from Bryan again after that phone call.\n-On Saturday, 6\/15, I received 5 missed calls and a voicemail from Darrel saying that he was loading my windows for installation, but because it was raining the caulk would not be able to dry so he would not be able to do the installation. I told him that I was not at home and in fact did not know I had an installation appointment because I had not heard from anyone at his company in 10 days. For my previous appointment, I received multiple e-mails saying when my appointment was scheduled & reminders leading up to the appointment. This time I had not received any e-mails or a phone call to tell me they had scheduled my appointment. Darrel told me to get a hold of Todd on Monday to schedule an installation. \n-On Monday, 6\/17, I called Todd to schedule an appointment for installation. He told me that he would try to get my on the calendar for 6\/29, but would call me back by the end of the week to confirm because he was in town from Ohio & would only be in town through the end of the week.  I also explained to him all of the above that had happened to try to get these windows installed & asked him who I could talk to about my issues to rectify the situation.  He told me that he was the guy because he was \"pretty high on the totem pole\". He said he would see what he could do & again reiterated that he would call me back by the end of the week with an installation appointment & an update on what they were willing to do to take care of me.

We were in Tennessee in November.  We parked in a lot and paid at the only kiosk that we saw in the parking lot.  There were four of us, and all four of us looked around to make sure we were paying in the right place.  This week (January 2019) I received a bill for $85 for a \"parking violation\".  I disputed the claim and sent them a copy of the receipt I had proving that I paid for parking, and we had not run out of time.  The dispute was denied and gave a number to call for the reason why it was disputed.  I called the number and left a message on someone's voicemail.  I have not been called back.  I would like to know why my disputed was denied and how they can charge $85 for \"PARKING VIOLATION\".  So with the $25 I paid the day of and the $85 being charged for a violation, that was a pretty expensive parking for less than 3 hours in downtown Nashville.","date":"2019-02-02 04:29:11"}

I was apprehensive to even write a review because the condition of my hair in the beginning was due to me being bored during this pandemic and impatience. But I was not satisfied with the end result, especially after spending around $280. \n\nThere were a couple of things I was not happy with and I felt maybe the biggest part lacking was communication and that is vital in any service role. \n\nMy hair was damaged, I bleached a lot of it myself and I also have hair that has had dark dyes added for years so the lighting process was sure to be hard plus there was color correction needed. Michelle told me that my hair was compromised but she would do her best to get it to where I wanted it to go, which we both understood may not happen today. That was fine, I know I can't take damaged hair that is half light brown still after 3 bleaches and half blonde and expect an even platinum. \n\nI showed up at my arrival time, but ended up waiting an hour to get started because she had another client. I took this in stride because I knew that the industry can be like that at time. I finally sat down and we talked and discussed my hair and goals. \n\nI told her I knew it was damaged and I wanted to chop it all off and my goal is platinum with silver and some lavender. She wanted to cut it first and then work on the color. We started the bleaching process. After that we rinsed and she mixed up color. Now, at this point I think communication went out of the window. She brought up 3 bowls and when she started applying what looks like a very violet color, I asked if she was toning it and she said yes. I was ok with that, because she applied it to my roots and I was a little concerned I was going to have some violet hair which was the opposite of what I was asking for. \n\nNow, she also added a smokey color to the ends, in an attempt to not only mask the brassiness but also because even though she was able to pull the ends from the much darker brown, it wasn't platinum yet and we both figured that wold happen. \n\nWe went to rinse, and this is hour FIVE at this point, somewhere at 7:00pm for a 2:00pm appointment. It was my birthday this day and I had people waiting on me at the house and I was pretty much ready to go and Michelle was working a double so we were both at the end of a long day. \n\nWe go back to the chair and my roots are violet purple. The mid parts of my long pixie style cut, the top\/bang part are much lighter, a bit brassy but that was understandable. You can't create miracles on compromised hair. \n\nWe went forward to dry and finish the cut. She thought I wanted something different, we ended up taking some more hair off the sides and it still wasn't quite what I was looking for so I pulled out my phone again. This was another place communication was lacking. We should of talked much more on the hair cut so that we didn't go back and forth so much, I began to feel that Michelle was starting to get a bit frustrated because I wasn't happy with the look of the short style. Mind you, I just went from slightly past the shoulder length hair to a very short style with bangs. So at this point I did want to just finish and I tried to talk to her about how I actually wanted my hair and about next time are we gong to be able to get the purple out and do it more toward the ends because that's what I actually wanted. I felt that she was done with me at this point, and to be honest after 5-6 hours on one head, I understood to a degree and I also wanted to get home for my birthday festivities. She added a texturized to my hair, it gave me the look I wanted and we parted ways. I get home, and of course my husband gave me compliments as dd my friends but my husband talked to me later and said he didn't know I was going for something so dark and he thought I was mainly going for platinum blonde with lavender and silver. I told him that was the goal and we can't get to it so fast, but that I also didn't know why I had violet purple roots. \n\nI asked her at the end if taking this purple out would be a problem and she said it wouldn't. But I will definitely talk to her and tell her my side of things and also ask that we communicate before doing anything involving color or cut and be sure we understand one another. \n\nMy advice to anybody is to communicate fully, don't assume that because the stylist is talented that she knows exactly what you want. This was our first visit together and we have to learn one another like any relationship but I am not fully satisfied and feel that the color could have been avoided with better communication.\n\nHad I known when I asked if she was toning my hair that it was actually a violet dye, I would have tried to fix it then but after so much time went by it was past the point of fixing my hair and fixing color that day.","date":"2020-12-05 14:35:01"}

Called the restaurant a week a head of time to make a reservation for my sons 21st birthday (his choice) they told me I needed to use Yelp to make the reservation. Yelp only allows up to 6 people we had 7. I made it for six and called the restaurant back, they said it wouldn't be a problem just tell the hostess when you arrive. I received my text the day before to confirm which I did but was worried about the sitting so I called the restaurant back again to make sure having 7 not 6 people would not be an issues. I was told you should be fine but if there was a problem ask for the manager. Not the answer I wanted but I said fine because this is where my son wanted to go. We got there last night (7:30 reservation) I went to the hostess and was asked if the 7 of us wanted to sit in a 6 person booth I said no there were 7 adults, I was told I then needed to be put on a waiting list since I had more people. Needless to say I was not happy and went over how many times I called to make sure 7 people would be fine. I was then seated at a long table which was perfect but then it went down hill from there. I get restaurants our short staffed but if you can not accommodate the reservations you are taking don't take them. I'm still paying the same price.  Our waiter was nice but mia most of the time. Water brought to the table when we sat at 7:30 we left at 9:30 - no water ever refilled and never asked if we wanted any drinks. Took our apps and dinner order together my son then asked for a drink as well as my husband. My sons came but not my husbands. Sat for an hour finally 6 of the 7 dinners came out - they forgot my sons order - we thought his just wasn't done until the waiter came back awhile later to ask if everything was ok. His meal did not come out until we were all done.  We were so frustrated and angry by the end no one even wanted dessert. They said they would take his meal off the bill. Bill arrived they took one steak off but still charged us for his first order so nothing taken off and charged us for a second drink we never received.  The manager came over to question why we were questioning the bill but he did not realize the whole issue with my sons meal. I was absolutely done at this point. The manager apologized and also took my sons apps and  drinks off as well. I never asked he just said he would. On top of it we drove an hour for this fiasco with my 80 year old parents.

Elite wireless group should be shut down for fraud! \n      My wife went to the store and was promised our bill would be $25 less and if we had any problems to come back and they would fix it.  The next month  our bill was $250 more but no one could figure out why and no one would fix it at the store. One of their shady employees had added an extra line from an old phone that was on my plan in 2012 by doing this I lost all of my loyalty credits from Sprint and Since this store wouldn't help me I was held to a two-year lease for a phone I didn't even have and was paying $30 a month for an IPhone 4s I had in 2012.! When I went into get it figured out \"Amanda\" the manager told me she couldn't help me. She said The employee that did this to us had been fired because he was fraudulently doing this so he could get credit, he had done this to multiple people  and that she talked to the district manager and that he wasn't willing to do anything either. I tried contacting the district manager. No luck! I called sprint fraud department and they couldn't get the district manager to call them back to figure out what was going on. once they get you to sign the paperwork you are screwed and you are held to a two-year lease.

I am talking to my lawyer this week to see if there is any legal action I can take against this store to help stop them from doing this to other people. I filed a complaint with sprint and I am calling the Better Business Bureau to file a complaint with them as well.

After we sat down, we ended up waiting about 10 minutes before any server noticed us. I tried to hunt one down, but they seemed very busy. \n\nWe ordered the guacamole starter, Denver scramble and breakfast burrito.\n\nThe guacamole was so sad. It was pure mashed avocado (no salt, no spices or fresh cilantro mixed in), with corn, sesame and cheese. It lacked brightness and flavor. Although, the chips were fresh.\n\nThe Denver scramble was decently tasty. It came with a side of sourdough toast and \"hash browns.\" I wouldn't call those hash browns though! It was a hybrid of hash and mashed potatoes mixed together, which was an odd texture combination for myself, personally.\n\nMy partner ordered the breakfast burrito. Maybe I'm biased because I'm from California, but when you get a breakfast burrito, you typically get a large burrito! This was a small breakfast burrito - maybe half the size that people usually get back west. My partner wouldn't have been full if we didn't order the starter and if he didn't snack off my meal too. \n\nOverall, the food was missing that \"wow\" factor when it comes to flavor for me. I probably won't come back unless I have a guest visit Nashville that prefers less daring and blander American food.

She said they attempted delivery, but no one was at the house.  I let her know that my son was stationed at an army base and that her explanation doesn't make sense because there's always someone there.   I told her I'd be down to the store to discuss further and that I need to get the package to him. \n\nBefore going to the store, I looked up the delivery history from the tracking number. It showed that the delivery driver made one attempt and no one was there so they dropped my box off to a UPS Access Point and waited to see if my son would come to pick it up before returning it back to the Campbell\/Prince UPS Store.\n\nFirst of all, my son is in basic training on an army base and cannot leave.  Secondly, why would they have not made 3 attempts to deliver the package?\n\nWhen I arrived at the store to discuss what transpired, the store manager Luisa was extremely dismissive. I asked her why the address was indicated as a residential address and why was only one attempt made to deliver the package?  She said that's up to UPS how they handle things. I told her that's her company,  could she look into this for me?  Again, she was dismissive and treated me like I was keeping her from something. There were only 2 customers in the store (myself and another person that was being helped by one of the other 2 associates in the store and who was not happy with the way she was being treated and overcharged)  so, I'm not sure why Luisa was treating me this way. \n\nShe said she'd be willing to ship it for me, but wouldn't cover the costs; I'd have to pay full price to ship out again.  I asked her if I could get a discount or something because this was not my fault,  I was paying for a service that was not fully accomplished by her company.  Again  she didn't care and was dismissive. I asked if we could file a claim to get my money or some of it back.  She told me she'd have to call to file it since it was sent out of her store.  I assumed she'd call them in front of me to make me confident that she was doing something about this or at least tell me that she'd contact me with a resolution.  No,  she simply walked away to the back as if I was keeping her from something vital. \n\nHer lack of customer service and dismissive attitude is the reason I left the store, drove further to the Wetmore store and sent my package from there. \n\nLuisa is in the wrong position.  She is in a customer service industry, yet shows zero care for her customers. If I was the franchise owner I would be frightened about the amount of business they're losing due to Luisa. I'm only saying this because within my visit, the only 2 customers in that store were both very unhappy with the way we were both treated (we discussed outside after exiting the store on the way to our cars). I  can't imagine how many times per day this occurs with Luisa in charge. \n\nAnyone reading this.. go to the Wetmore store between Stone and 1st. The franchise owner works out of that store, and is very nice, patient, and actually likes his customers.  He was willing to help me out with my transaction and listen to my story to ensure I wouldn't be dealing with an Access Point issue again, since I never requested that service to begin with.

Coming from the Southwest and having spent extensive time in Mexico, this is not authentic Mexican food. At least not from what we ordered: nachos and a burrito. It was more like store bought items that you could throw together yourself easily without a lot of flavor. The burrito was a wrapped flour tortilla (not corn!!), with some sautéed veggies and beef thrown in that was seasoned with chili powder. The nachos were just melted cheese and a few jalapeños on hard, unsalted, flavorless white corn chips--the same chips that were brought to our table with liquidy salsa. Salsa should be chunky! And the atmosphere was very noisy and crowded, and the huge dining room very bright. Not much ambiance. We were squeezed into a tiny free-standing table between other diners and the kid next to us kept running around our table (I know. That's not the restaurant's fault, but maybe if we weren't all so crammed in. That's greed)... The only reason I'm giving my review 3 stars and not 2 is the frozen margarita.

I asked if we could replace the soup on the lunch combo with an egg roll and she scolded me and said ABSOLUTLEY NO WAY! Like she was scary!! And then I had to fight with her to get her to separate the checks!  All of that was just over the phone!  Then I get there to pick up the food.  Oh boy!  I could see directly into the kitchen as I was paying for our food...did not like what I saw.  But I gave them the benefit of the doubt, hoping it was just clutter and not filth.  My co-worker and I both used our debit cards.  When I was paying with my co-workers card, and didn't leave a tip..the lady was obviously upset about it.  So, noticing that, I left her a tip when I paid with my card, and she didn't seem thrilled with the amount of tip I left.  I am usually a good tipper, but she was so rude, she's lucky she got anything.  Now on to the food...OMG! The wonton was so hard it could've broken our teeth.  The crab Rangoon was also very hard and gross.  The sweet and sour sauce given to us for the Rangoon tasted like straight beer!!

My sisters ombré nails looked good ... I believe it was Helena who did them. Me did my pedi which was pretty good but my dip manicure was very poor. I am used to them being filed down to look thin and natural. They were chunky and looked like blobs on my nails. She also left dip\/polish stains all over my fingers and cuticles. She got a new client while my top coat was drying so when I asked her to clean them up she rushed and still left a lot behind for me to clean off myself when I got home. Given that they were so busy I wasn't going to make a fuss and was going to try and call to schedule to come back in so they had time to actually fix them. I went back today (the next day) to try and get them filed down more and to look more natural. Unfortunately Me was the one to do them again ... while they looked a little better they still weren't great. As soon as the rain hit my nails when leaving the top coat got these weird white splotches ...I sat under the dryer so they should have been dry and she told me I could leave. Typically after my dip is filed down there is a sealant or something that is put on before the top coat. I don't know if because she didn't do that it caused the issue.  They also look rough with file lines all in them versus smooth like they usually are. I was really hoping after I got my nails fixed I would consider going back in the future but I think I will continue the hunt for a good nail place when I am visiting my family here.","date":"2021-12-28 18:14:40"}

Because I want Moonlight Boba in my life often.\n\n   ---   ---   ---\n\nI recently sent my wife the Moonlight Boba Yelp listing because her office is not too terribly far away and she loves boba. The reviews are pretty amazing, but I'm not in Pinellas Park very often, so I figured she'd be able to enjoy it before I would. Fortunately, we actually happened to be in the area, so we stopped by and I'm completely in love after one visit. \n\nAt first, my wife just had me run inside and order a taro boba for her. I planned on grabbing a couple drinks to go and heading home, but I saw the waffle ice cream concoctions on the menu and thought that it would be much better to eat-in. Every waffle looked amazing, but the \n\"Rainbow In My Hand\" with cotton candy ice cream, gummies and mochi's really caught my eye.\n\nThe saying \"explosion of flavor\" is cliche, but I don't know any other more accurate way to describe this. You got creamy, sour, sweet, mushy, hard and dense in every bite. It's quite a lot for your taste buds to process, but I liked it. With that being said, I'd opt for something like the Cookielicious or the Snow White next time, just for a bit more continuity.\n\nAlso, my coconut boba smoothie and her taro milk tea were both top notch.\n\nBut then as we were leaving, my wife pointed out a sign off to the side that showed ice cream boba's. And I have to tell you, outside of a sign that said, \"Brett, you've won a new car,\" I don't know if I could have been happier to see that particular set of information.\n\nI'd recently been introduced to ice cream boba's in San Francisco and fell head over heels in love. I was told that they only recently made their way to the United States and were super hard to find. I knew that probably meant I wouldn't find them in Tampa Bay until about 2024, when they'd be old news in SF. So to find them about 3 weeks later in Pinellas Park, I was ecstatic. \n\nI'd already had a small dessert before arriving at Moonlight Boba + ordered a boba smoothie and an ice cream waffle here. I wanted to fully enjoy this ice cream boba, so we hopped in the car, drove about 40 minutes home to Tampa, froze them and ate them the next day. They were still just as unbelievable as I remembered, despite nearly melting away in the car the day before. Do yourself the greatest favor and go to Moonlight Boba for many things, but especially for the ice cream boba's before they sell out!\n\nAs I said, we aren't in Pinellas Park often, but if timing\/circumstances work out, I know exactly where I'm coming for my sweet fix.","date":"2020-02-18 11:47:10"}

So I took my vegan pal along with me and headed over for lunch.\n\nWe were greeted by a super friendly person behind the counter who gave us a full rundown of the menu. I opted for the gyro, a side of mac-n-cheese, a chickpea curry patty and a cookie butter milkshake.\n\nThe milkshake was by far and away the highlight for me. I'd absolutely come back here again to try the other flavors. I honestly thought it was just as delicious as any legit milkshake. It was slightly lighter, which made it easier to drink, but not so light that you felt like the quality was sacrificed.  And as someone who is a bit lactose intolerant, my body was grateful for the dairy alternative.\n\nMy favorite food item was definitely the chickpea curry patty. I'm all in when it comes to curry and those really hit the spot.\n\nThe gryo and the mac-n-cheese - while not unenjoyable, I'd much rather just eat the real version.

I asked to sub rice noodles for the usual spaghetti noodles for an extra 2 dollars which brought my plate of noodles up to $12 which was OK with me. When I got them they were lukewarm. The special noodle sauce consisted of fish sauce and about a quarter cup of sugar. no salt , no garlic no cilantro or black pepper to give the dish any kind of flavor. Ick! The dish was so sweet. To top it off the frozen squid strips tasted slightly freezer burned. I think the chef (and I use the term loosely) may have been trying to cover up the fact that the squid were slightly off by making them taste sweet like good fresh squid should be.

Others had the Ginger Daiquiri and ultimately switched to the Pear Margarita.\n\nOne disclaimer, which is the reason for my one less star than perfect experience is that the General Tso's Chicken and the Sesame Chicken are essential the same exact dish. We ordered both, and had to ask the waiter first if we were brought two of the same dish. Then we asked what the difference was in the sauces, because we were not able to discern this on our own. Our waiter asked the chef, and reported back that the main difference is that the General Tso's should have more of a kick while the Sesame is more orange based. We could not tell the difference, and I'd recommend that if you're between the two to just flip a coin because the flavors are identical.\n\nBeyond that, the chicken was delicious. The side of long beans we ordered were great, as were the veggies in the Old City. The star of the food menu was easily the Mei Mei Fried Rice. The sausage was insanely delicious. I am craving it while writing this review right now.

This is one of the best restaurants I've been to this summer, and one that I can't wait to return to enjoy (unlike others, where I felt I 'should' go back just to give a second chance, e.g. Kanella and Bibou).\n\nThe food is everything others here have raved about.  I'm an omnivore (tho I try to limit red meat), but never thought vegan could taste so good, and be so creatively and beautifully presented.  The flavors and presentations were Wow-some.  The standouts were the shaved brussel sprouts (from the dirt menu) -- best brussel sprouts ever; and the golden beet terrine, which was served with a vegan dill sourcream sauce and some capers and diced avocado --together the textures and colors were reminiscent of smoked salmon; it was divine; the maitake mushroom was meaty, mushroomy heaven; the radish sampler was presented as though it was sushi\/sashimi at a Japanese restaurant. Less impressive was a summer bean dish and sweet potato fois gras on the dirt list. Some of the yellow wax beans were tough, and the sweet potato fois gras was pureed sweet potatoes (albeit presented nicer and with a foam or sauce.  These did not impress.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the sorbet trio, and the cheesecake.  The sorbets were flavor-popping, especially the strawberry and the tangerine.\n\nIt's not inexpensive, that's for sure.  But to me it was worth every bite.","date":"2013-07-21 13:29:24"}

The soup didn't have enough lemongrass in it for my taste, but it was still decent. But, the tuna avocado salad---boy, that was so good! Let me be clear, this isn't canned tuna, but rather delicious Ahi tuna. And they weren't skimpy with the avocado either! I would suggest ordering this!\n\nUnfortunately, the entrees didn't give as much punch as the tuna avocado salad. My partner ordered the drunken noodles and asked for it to come spicier, but neither the flavor or the spice deliver. Whomp. I ended up with panang curry with tofu. Again, we asked for that dish to come spicier. It didn't come as spicy as we wanted. Maybe we have a high tolerance for heat, but I was disappointed with the final product. \n\nOverall, not a terrible experience, but maybe next time, I might have to try something different on the menu!","date":"2015-10-29 00:58:39"}

My family and I spent the afternoon on the beach recently. After soaking in all of the rays, we found ourselves extremely hungry (and sunburnt) searching for our next meal. That is when we stumbled in to Sea Critters.\n\nIt seemed that they were preparing for some sort of karaoke event, but we made our way through to find an open table on the outside back dock. With the open water, parked boats and smell of seafood, we felt right at home.\n\nWe arrived in time for their daily Happy Hour and took advantage of their $3.50 margaritas. They hit the spot. While waiting, our server brought a complimentary loaf of ciabiatta bread with a Mango Cherry chutney butter. The bread was fresh and very warm. It was on point.\n\nWhile waiting for our main course, I made my way in to the bathroom. It was absolutely filthy and looked like it had been neglected for some time. There was plenty of staff clocked in that could have taken care of this at any time. \n\nThe kitchen however was super quick. By the time I returned to the table, our Gator Bites had arrived. Boasting to be caught wild in Plant City, I found myself questioning the validity of that claim. Realistically, who cares? And how do you back that up? We're in Florida. Home of the Gators. They're everywhere! These were served up hand-breaded, fried and with a side of horseradish sauce. Pretty tasty, but much smaller in size than what I was hoping for.\n\nI ordered the \"Hog Wings\". The menu describes them as \"fall-off-the-bone tender pork shanks served Buffalo or BBQ Style\". I chose the Buffalo style. Honestly, it was Franks red hot sauce. Again, small quantity. I found myself wishing I had about twice as much... And I'm not a heavy eater. It is on the Appetizer menu, so keep that in mind when you think it is enough to be a meal.\n\nMy daughter ordered the Cuban sandwich with fries. Maybe I'm a purist, but I didn't feel that it was an authentic representation of a Cuban. It tasted fine, but something was off with the pork. The fries were of the potato wedge variety. There were no complaints from my daughter.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Rockefeller Scallops Risotto. It was very soupy, but the scallops were cooked perfect. \n\nOverall, we had a pleasant experience on a nice Florida day. The server was quick and friendly. The kitchen was quick and accurate. We would probably eat here again if given another opportunity.","date":"2019-07-03 02:51:17"}

One person could order and finish around 3-5 tapas depending on your appetite.  on this trip I started out with the champiñones al ajillo (mushrooms sauteed with garlic), and the bread goes very well if you dip it in the sauce that the plate comes in.  Then we moved on to the gambas al ajillo (amazing flavor), gambas a la parrilla (amazing los delish), batatas bravas (potatoes on a creamy sauce \"spicy\" according to them but is not at all... and its a must), albondigas (meat balls), almejas, ox tail (so tender and flavorful), chorizo al brandy and that was a perfect meal for 3.

I have been obsessed with Porta Pizza. I have been there a lot this past summer and I can't get enough! They surprise me every time I come in for dinner or drinks. \n\nPorta has a very rustic appearance with bright lights and music that intrigue you to go in. I have been here several times for dinner and drinks. Porta's pizza is fantastic. I seriously cannot get enough. Some of the pizzas I have tried is the Carbonara Pizza, Margherita, Festivus, 14 & a half pizza, House Party, and Chenzino pizza. I have clearly tried too many of the pizzas on the menu but they are all excellent. I think the Carbonara pizza is still my all time favorite, but you won't be disappointed with any of the pizzas on the menu. \n\nThe appetizers are also very good. I am a huge fan of the Many-Thanks Sliders and Meatball Sliders. Some of the other times that I have been to Porta were for the drinks. This summer they are doing The Twice is Right Tuesday's. Every Tuesday you can enjoy a bar crawl to four different bars in Porta Pizza and another connecting bar. At the end of the night, once you have you have all four punches in your punch card, you have a chance to win a prize! Some prizes include gift cards, free drinks, etc. I had a lot of fun during the bar crawl and met a lot of new people.  \n\nLastly, Porta just opened up the top Mezzanine. At the mezzanine, you can enjoy a great view overlooking Porta pizza, sit at the bar and listen to the DJ while enjoy some amazing artwork that is up there. I think Porta is a great option to go to any time of the week. They have so much to offer!","date":"2018-08-04 17:47:21"}

My friend was right - the cheesesteaks were among the best we've had outside of Philly and New York, and we were disappointed to find the next time we visited Enterprise that New York Richie's had closed that location.\n\nSo you can imagine my excitement when Cindi called me on the way home from work one evening a few weeks ago to tell me there was a New York Richie's sign at the old Round Table \/ Atza pizza location on Glenwood Street across from Hawks Stadium.  According to some posts on the Oregon New York Richie's Facebook page, there was no business connection between the Idaho and Oregon New York Richie's locations, but the food would be the same.  We stopped in today, their second day of business, to see just how close the food came to what we had enjoyed so much in Enterprise.\n\nI'm happy to report that we were not disappointed.  The cheesesteaks were as good as we remembered - the meat was tender and flavorful, with just the right amount of grilled onions, roasted red peppers, mushrooms, and Swiss and provolone cheeses.  The bread was fresh and chewy, as good as we've had in Philly, if a little smaller in diameter than authentic Philly steaks.  The fries were crispy and well seasoned, and included Richie's trademark chipotle fry sauce.  While we were eating, we saw a monster 20\" thin crust cheese pizza make its way to the next table, and made a mental note that we had to try the pizza on our next visit.\n\nOur only disappointments:  First, the price.  At $8.95 for a sandwich with no fries, Richie's is charging $2-3 more than Philly prices for their steaks.  (In fairness, the pizza prices seemed very reasonable, starting at $16.50 for the 20\" cheese pizza.)  Secondly, any place that claims to serve genuine Philly cheesesteaks needs to have Cheez Whiz available as a topping option.\n\nBut all in all, we're happy as can be to finally have a real cheesesteak available in Boise.","date":"2011-05-01 02:12:35"}

My DP and I sampled a few things off the menu and found everything good, but there were no wows per se (i.e. not a 5-star eatery).  \n\nMarhaba does its own take on a number of Lebanese dishes, but still have a lot of core items and dipping sauces, which I liked very much.  The portions are large, which the menu mentions.  I found them overly large, tbh.\n\nHere's what I had:\n\nKaffa Brad - they serve this freshly puffed, and it's quite good.  I'm used to it being served with hummus or salatim, which wasn't the case here.  It was just a stack of very good bread.  I think a lot of people would like this though.\n\nLentil Soup with Fried Onions - Very rich, tasty dish.  I liked the spices and they added some heat.  The fried onions added a savory element and a different texture, although once they soaked up the soup they lost their crispness.\n\nChicken Schwarma Platter - So good.  Chicken was tender and well spiced and a very large portion to boot.  I thought the yellow saffron rice was too flavorful and crowded out some of the chicken flair.  I'm used to the chicken being served a top white basmati rice, which may flow together a bit more naturally.  The side Mediterranean salad was nice and bright, although I'm not as big on olive oil as most.  The chicken schwarma came with two sauces, tahini and a garlic, very classic.  I added their famous green hot sauce since I'm a sucker for some kick.  All were great and tasted homemade.\n\nMy DP got the lamb gyro, which was tasty, very meaty and came on a fresh pita.  He had some sauce envy, however, when he saw my accompaniments.\n\nNext time I might try the lamb chops or lamb kebab to see how juicy they push their proteins.\n\nOne other note, try not to sit by the door in the winter, as the draft can be cumbersome.  Prices are inexpensive.  It's BYOB.","date":"2015-01-23 23:52:03"}

These are the best calzones, hands down, t hat I've ever eaten. Crust is flavorful and baked to that golden-brown, crispy-chewy perfection that satisfies the soul. And there isn't *too much* of it -- it's always perfectly filled, to every single corner, with melty, gooey, cheesy goodness. It comes with a variety of truly homemade-tasting sauces, all of which I'd be proud to have made myself, from the simple garlic butter to the roasted-tomato smoky goodness of the thick red sauce. \n\nBut the standout, here, is the fillings. Creative and epic combinations, combining sweet and savory, spicy and creamy, rich and fresh and smoky... again, these are characteristics I seek in my own kitchen, my own recipes, which I take a great deal of pride in. \n\nSo! Last night His Goatness and I binged on the Carmen, the Figgy Piggy, and the Garden. \n\nThe Carmen: Prosciutto, Capicola, Spinach, Parmesan, Fontina, Ricotta, Garlic Oil. So much flavor, even from the various cheeses, and the garlic oil wasn't buried... it allowed a perfect melding of flavor, with a bit of freshness from the spinach. Warm and creamy. Served with garlicky garlic butter. \n\nThe Figgy Piggy: Applewood Smoked Bacon, Figs, Balsamic Onions, Garlic Herb Cheese, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Garlic Honey Oil. Dear gods, I love the combination of figs, balsamic onions, and bacon. The perfect blend of sweet and savory... this was far and away my favorite, and will be a treat I savor many times in the future. It was served, again, with simple garlic butter, allowing the ingredients to shine -- I didn't use it. It wasn't necessary. There wasn't too much crust. \n\nThe Garden: Balsamic Eggplant, Spinach, Zucchini, Roasted Garlic, White Onions, Snow Peas, Mozzarella, Ricotta, Garlic Oil. I substituted artichoke hearts for snow peas -- the snow peas (which I do love) didn't seem quite in harmony with the Mediterranean ingredients. They were generous with the artichoke hearts, and the whole thing came together flawlessly. It was served with their smoky, thick \"House Red\" sauce, which complemented the calzone marvelously. \n\nA blowout binge that was worth. Every. Calorie. Every single one.","date":"2022-01-19 18:59:27"}

The waitress told us that The Farm Burger is the most popular. I for one have never had a burger with an egg and the thought of it isn't very appealing. \n\nI ended up ordering the 'Pharmacy Burger', which is a less cheesier version of their 'Cheese Burger' that my husband ordered. They LOADED the mustard, but that really wasn't what I didn't like about it. It really wasn't that I disliked the burger, it just wasn't anywhere near one of the best burgers that I've had. The extra toppings at fifty cents each are pretty skimpy too. I was a fan of the wasabi aioli though. I also loved the tater tots though. I highly recommend ordering tater tots over the french fries. The beer cheese dipping sauce was an extra dollar and was borderline disgusting. Stick with wasabi aioli. \n\nI'm thinking that the toppings and sauces are possibly what the hype about this place is, otherwise, I just don't get it. To describe this place in one word... overhyped.","date":"2018-01-02 22:50:47"}
